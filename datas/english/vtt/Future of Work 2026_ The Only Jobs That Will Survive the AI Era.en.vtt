00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.480
Just this year, more than 100,000 tech

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.720
workers worldwide have been laid off

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.679
across companies like Amazon, Intel,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.080
Microsoft, Meta, IBM, and Salesforce.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:17.760
Amazon alone cut 14,000 corporate roles.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.600
Clariner reduced its staff by nearly 40%

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.600
as it leaned into guess what? AI.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.920
Dualingo is phasing out human

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.240
contractors in favor of automation. And

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.640
this isn't limited to tech. In the UK,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.040
one in six employers now expect AI to

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.760
reduce their workforce in the next year

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.079
with junior roles hit first. AI

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.840
political turbulence, economic pressure.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.559
Together, they've created what some

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.239
people are already calling apocalypse.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.960
And here's the paradox. Companies

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.120
publicly say, "If we don't adopt AI, we

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.680
won't exist in 15 years." And at the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.760
same time, they're hiring fewer juniors

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.239
than ever. It really feels to me like

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.719
this first step of the career ladder is

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.879
cracking. And if that first step is

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.440
gone, what does that mean for the future

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.840
work and for the careers of recent

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.400
graduates? On my podcast, Silicon Valley

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.799
Girl, I talk to CEOs, investors and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.760
founders who are actually hiring people

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.360
and who are building the AI tools

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.799
everyone is so anxious about. And you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.040
know, I'm a mom. I have a six-year-old

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.439
and a four-year-old. I used to worry

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.600
about my career. Now I'm worried about

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.520
my daughter's future because it's so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.680
unpredictable. And that's one of the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.600
reasons why I do the podcast because I

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.520
want to hear from those people. I want

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.520
to ask my questions as a moment as an

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.240
immigrant. And in this video, I want to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.640
bring their insights together and show

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.360
you which jobs are actually at risk,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.520
which careers will grow because of AI,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.720
and what you can do right now to make

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.560
your career as AI proof as possible.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.119
Let's start with what's really happening

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.040
to jobs today. When I talk to founders

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.920
and CEOs, they all say the same thing.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.640
In five years, we will most likely have

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.880
AGI and there will be massive

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.680
unemployment. For decades, the life

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.160
formula was simple. Go to school, get a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.080
degree, get a job. Now, the formula is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.640
breaking. Education prices keep going

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.520
up. But graduate job openings in some

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.360
countries are down by 40%. So, if the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.879
job market feels like a closed door,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.080
it's not because you're doing something

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:26.319
wrong. The system is preparing people

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.920
for a world that does not exist anymore.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.840
And here's how Daniel Priestley, a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.360
British entrepreneur and founder,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.040
describes this gap.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.440
>> It's both. It's the easiest and the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.040
worst time. So is there's more money

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.120
than ever before. There's more

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.959
opportunities than ever before. You can

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.280
reach global markets faster than ever

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.200
before. So in theory, it should be the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360
easiest time. The reason it's not the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.519
easiest time is because our schooling

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.920
system is rooted in the industrial age

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.840
and it's built around getting people

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.959
ready for factories and offices that no

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.120
longer exist really. So the the reason

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.879
that so many people are struggling is

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.280
because they went through this arduous

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.440
training day after day after day for 12

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.560
15 years preparing them for an

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.040
industrialized economy. And when they

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.280
get out there all of these skills make

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.120
them very functional. But now we have

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.200
automation and outsourcing.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.800
>> Yeah. And it's like great, we trained

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.560
you as a large language model that's not

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.200
as good as the the current version.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.319
>> Yeah.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.879
>> Teaching people to do functional work

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.640
that can be automated or outsourced way

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.120
faster, way cheaper, way easier.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.560
Especially in the west, you are not only

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.840
in competition with the technology,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.000
you're also in competition with someone

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.440
who's armed with the same technology in

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.720
a country where you can live pretty

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.959
large on half the price.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.760
>> Yeah. So the question isn't do I have a

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.720
degree anymore? The real questions are,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.680
can I solve ambitious problems end to

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.680
end employing those AI tools? Can AI

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.080
actually 10x my output? Can I do

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.159
something beyond what a model and a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.400
cheaper freelancer could do together?

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.799
And that leads us to the next part.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.280
Which jobs are actually in danger and

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.680
why? When people ask which jobs will AI

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.840
replace, they expect to hear coders,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.319
designers, maybe copyriters. But the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.799
reality is more nuanced and in some ways

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.159
more scary. So I asked perplexity to

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.480
analyze my portfolio.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.160
>> Okay.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.479
>> And I asked it whether I should fire my

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.079
financial advisor and it was like yes

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.440
you should do this immediately. Like

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.240
that that's the first time I saw

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.000
something

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.759
>> that definitive from AI like what's

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.320
going to happen to these professions

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.080
financial advisors real estate brokers

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.520
>> because perplexity does it now and it

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.440
created the whole strategy for me to

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.520
rebalance and everything. getting the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.600
listings on like Redin or Zillow with

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.080
like a comet like browser or say you

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.840
just have a recurring task that's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.840
running doesn't work yet but it's going

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.759
to work pretty soon which is you could

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.080
just have a task that says you know

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.320
everyday morning just look at all the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.680
new listings on Red Fin uh have

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.240
something like every time there's a

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.160
house below a certain budget uh and and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.560
that's within this neighborhood make

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.160
sure to like send me a push notification

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.919
uh and and submit an application on my

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.759
behalf and schedule a meeting for a

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.120
visit. you have access to my calendar,

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.320
everything you can you can.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.160
>> So, just take

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.039
>> So, if your agent only shows you

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.960
listings on Redin and Zillow, I I think

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.880
they're useless. But if your agent is

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.880
doing offmarket deals for you, they're

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.320
still pretty useful because those things

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.800
do not exist on the web.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.199
>> Okay.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.720
>> I feel like having the power of like

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.759
intelligence and computer at your hands,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.160
it always comes back to that means you

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.880
can push uh the existing industry to

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.720
like like work harder for you. Uh same

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.720
thing with private wealth management or

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.320
financial advisors like what are if the

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.000
job of the financial advisor to tell you

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.840
like what stocks to buy then I don't

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.600
think they're not going to be smarter

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.960
than perplexity which you can go and

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.039
summon and and ask it to go read all the

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.960
uh analyst reports in every stock and

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.240
like all the morning day news and like

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.560
come back to you and tell you like the

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.880
impact on your portfolio. Uh what would

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.280
Warren Buffett do if he had exact

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.800
exactly your portfolio? like like it can

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.479
answer questions like that that no

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.479
financial advisor can.

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.400
>> But if your financial advisor does more

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.680
stuff for you like getting you some

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.639
access to uh certain funds like private

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.479
equity or hedge funds or or access to

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.639
like funds or citadel or like some

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.639
startups, venture capital which you

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.400
cannot get through uh just the public

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.039
markets then maybe they're useful,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.520
right?

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.360
>> Clear pattern shows up. AI is not

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.280
killing entire professions. It's killing

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.600
the shallow version of those

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.400
professions. A lawyer who just rewrites

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.319
templates, that's easy to automate. A

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.600
financial adviser who just picks a few

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:37.680
mutual funds from a list, also easy to

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.400
replace. Um, you can already do that

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.800
with perplexity. A real estate agent who

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.120
only sends you Zillow links, you don't

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.360
need a human for that. But a lawyer who

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.759
negotiates, strategizes, and builds deep

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.520
trust with clients, very valuable. An

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.880
adviser who gets you into deals you

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.800
can't Google. Oh my god. Yes, please. An

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.919
agent who finds offmarket properties and

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.240
navigates messy human situations. Oh my

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.400
god. Yes, I've been through that. I

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.120
relied on my person. I just talked to

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.880
someone who runs a nonprofit helping

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.520
students from low-income families apply

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.759
to colleges. And she actually sees how

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.720
AI is helping them because because prior

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.639
to AI, one tutor could only help a few

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.680
students. Now one tutor is helping

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.759
hundreds of students and because AI can

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.840
answer a lot of generic questions and

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:28.160
she highlighted that they still need

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.560
humans there to motivate people. And

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.160
this is why uh students from those

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.919
low-income families come to her

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.240
nonprofit because they need that

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.479
support. They need a human to tell them

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.080
you can do it. You're worth it. You can

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:41.840
apply to that college. And it was super

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.759
important to me when I was applying to

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.800
colleges when somebody from Education

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:48.240
USA told me you can do it. And yes, I

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.000
could Google a lot of things myself, but

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.919
I can't Google motivation. What I'm

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.879
saying here is that AI isn't replacing

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:56.720
law or finance or real estate as fields.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:59.039
It is replacing job descriptions that

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.560
are too basic. And that's exactly why so

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.560
many people decide to build their own

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.960
thing instead of fighting for one of

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.560
those shrinking roles. Before we go

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.400
deeper, I want to pause here for a

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.240
moment. Whenever I talk to founders or

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.560
creators, one thing keeps coming up. As

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.639
AI reshapes the job market, more people

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.800
are choosing to build their own thing.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:19.039
startup service, a personal brand, and

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.360
even in an AI world where a search is

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:23.919
completely different now, you still need

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.000
a place where your work lives, a website

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:28.400
or a page that shows what you do and one

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.639
that both your customers and their AIs

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.399
can actually find. Oh my god, I can't

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:34.479
believe I've been saying that. But yes,

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:36.399
AI is now making a lot of purchasing

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:38.800
decisions. And the challenge is if you

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:40.560
ever try to register good.com, you know

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.120
the struggle. Most great names are

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.800
already taken or cost a fortune. That's

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.360
why I was really excited when I found

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.760
aonline domains. It's the world's second

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.720
largest new domain extension trusted by

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.880
over 3.5 million businesses and online

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.440
is such a strong keyword. It's searched

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.680
more than 500 million times every month

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.920
which actually helps you grow site rank

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.519
higher. What I love about online is how

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.920
universal it is. It works for

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:07.680
freelancers, creators, AI startups,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.000
anyone who needs a clean professional

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.839
digital home. Even platforms like Skill

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Up use it. And one of my favorite

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:15.680
examples, the classic Mindeeper, the

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.279
game a lot of you guys spend hours

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.120
playing, now lives at

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:21.600
mindepeeper.online.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.360
And because.com is so crowded, doonline

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.440
gives you room to get the name you

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.360
actually want without weird numbers or

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.279
dashes. So if you're building an AI

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.519
product, launching a side project, or

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:33.440
finally creating your own portfolio, now

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:35.360
is the perfect moment to grab your

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.000
domain. And for a limited time, you can

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.680
get a online domain for just 99 cents

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.200
for the first year with my link and

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.440
coupon code. Just go to www.get.online

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.760
or use the code from the description and

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.760
secure your name today. So, let's look

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.000
at the job loss problem at a different

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.000
angle. Let's say you already have a

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.160
pretty good job and you like it and it's

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.160
interesting. You're inside the company.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.440
You see all these changes and you're

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.480
thinking, "Okay, how do I not get

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.320
replaced by the next wave of tools?" I

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.880
asked my guests what they're doing with

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.800
their own teams right now. there's still

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.920
higher value work to do.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.680
>> So, they're still in the companies.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.519
>> They're still in the companies and

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.440
there's still work to be done. Like

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:19.279
everything's elevating, but what we

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.120
discovered is that there's this there's

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:22.800
this ability to pull the scalable

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.079
element out and address a market that

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.279
was never even being addressed.

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:27.519
>> So, it's not like you're replacing

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:28.079
people, it's more of you're elevating

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.519
them.

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:32.160
>> There's definitely an element of

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:34.560
replacing people. Um, and that is

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.760
because there are always these jobs that

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:41.200
are repetitive, functional, annoying,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.640
frustrating jobs that we can actually

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.160
replace. There are some people who say,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.920
"I don't want to elevate up." And

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.200
unfortunately, there's not much I can do

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.040
if you don't want to elevate. If you

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.680
don't want to play at the higher game,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.079
I'm moving fast. So, you've got to

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.800
either elevate towards that or find

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:57.120
something else.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.519
>> Yeah, this is basically the new contract

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.839
at work. AI takes the boring repeatable

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:04.560
tasks. human move up to higher value

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:07.279
problems. If you refuse to move up, you

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.360
eventually move out. And big tech CEOs

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:11.360
are thinking the exact same way.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.279
>> We see big companies put a stop on

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.720
hiring and they say like, "Hey, to their

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:16.720
employees, you need to figure out how to

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.160
do this with AI first before we hire

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.640
someone." What do you think about that?

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.240
I think it's a reflection of you know a

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.480
fast changing market and a lot of

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.880
uncertainty uh both you know in the

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.320
political uh uh environment and in the

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.120
tech environment of where things are

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.519
going and the natural tendency to do is

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.040
to go slower a little bit. Um, and you

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:37.440
may might decide, you know, some people

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.680
are no longer the right folks in my

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.600
company for that kind of environment

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.360
where things are moving incredibly fast,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.120
where you're almost forced to use AI to

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.560
keep up with the competition. Like the

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.720
realization I think that many companies

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.399
had in the last few months is that if we

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.040
have employees that say we don't want to

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:56.880
use AI, that ultimately means up we as a

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.200
company are no longer set up for success

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.959
because our competitors are all using AI

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.720
or they're mandating AI. And I think

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:04.480
this is the transition phase we're going

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.120
through. You know, things like Mark

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.760
Zuckerberg uh getting the scale scale AI

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.839
team.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.360
I I think that shows where Mark's head

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:15.040
is and where he believes the future is

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.000
going to be. He's going he's willing to

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.000
invest into it.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.320
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, if you already have a

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.480
job, your number one goal is very

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.880
simple. Become the person who knows how

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.399
to do your job with AI, not in spite of

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.399
it. And if you're a manager and you're

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:30.320
watching this, another meaningful thing

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:32.000
I took away from a conversation with

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.760
this lady who runs this nonprofit

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.240
helping students apply to colleges. And

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.560
when she was introducing this AI tool,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.639
she was talking to her team, she told

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.240
them to focus on the problem that

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:44.639
they're solving with this tool because

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.639
that tool allowed her team to spend

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:48.800
their limited amount of time on actually

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:51.200
encouraging students to apply and

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.880
motivating them versus answering generic

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.959
questions. So in order to become a

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.920
person who knows how to do their job

00:12:54.959 --> 00:13:00.560
with AI, you can start with really easy

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.880
practical exercise. Ask yourself what

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.959
are the three most repetitive things I

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.120
do every week? Is it writing emails,

00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:10.399
making reports, doing research, cleaning

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.720
data? Then build a tiny AI system around

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:15.600
each one. This can be prompts, small

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.760
automations, agents, very basic,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.279
anything that saves time. I really like

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.079
spaces and perplexity. feel like I have

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:24.399
a space for my high cholesterol. I have

00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:26.639
a space for guests that I'm researching.

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:29.600
And then you just notice how you save 30

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:31.920
to 50% of your time on that repetitive

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.160
stuff. I don't type my emails anymore. I

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.560
just talk to chat GPT and it writes my

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.880
emails. So keep asking myself, what

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.959
higher level work can I move to? Where

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.200
is this highest ROI? Where should I

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:45.760
invest more time in? And where should I

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.720
delegate to AI? That's how you move from

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.959
replaceable task doer to irreplaceable

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.920
operator. That brings us to one of my

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:55.600
favorite questions. My daughters are

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.920
four and six and I always ask

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.959
entrepreneurs, what skills should our

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:04.000
kids learn for this new world? And

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:06.560
honestly, the answer is very similar for

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.800
them and for us. Generally speaking, AI

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.639
don't suggest waiting because part of

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.320
what you want to be doing, you know,

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:14.560
just like any new technological

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.920
revolution, whether when YouTube was

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.000
happening, when the internet's

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.639
happening, the folks who go and adopt

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.279
and play with it early then have a

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:25.600
differential edge in the change that it

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:28.160
means in the industry, in their society.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.720
And so even though three years from now

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.199
the coding tools will be and agents will

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.880
be much better than they are now the

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:36.720
people who started playing with them now

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.320
will probably be the people who know how

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.600
to use them and deploy them much more

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.519
comfortably early.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.760
>> So what do you think uh parents should

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:46.399
be teaching their kids now? I think it's

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.160
still important to be good at like

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:51.279
learning knowledge from first principles

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.440
yourself and not depending on the sort

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:54.800
of AI tutor leading you through. Like I

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.480
think one of the most important things

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.720
is from school is the discipline of

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.320
being able to teach yourself. That's a

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.639
meta skill

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.959
>> and that you know that that comes with

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:09.519
friction. So I think as a parent you

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:11.279
still have to introduce like discipline

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:13.360
and friction into the process because if

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:16.399
it comes all too slowly and it's always

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.079
on tap you know then the then there's a

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:20.160
risk that the child could just get used

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:23.120
to having everything instantly available

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.880
and doesn't learn from the hard work um

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.240
you know the benefits of hard work which

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.519
I think are important. So that's like

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.800
something to think through now that

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:30.399
everything is going to be so seamless.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.519
Then I asked the founder of Replet,

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:35.120
Amjad, what he's teaching his own kids

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:36.480
because he's an immigrant and his kids

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.560
are the same age as mine.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.720
>> When I'm thinking about my kids and what

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.120
we're going to do in the future, I think

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.120
about this idea of being more of a

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.959
polymath, right? Like if you think

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.639
about, you know, even before the

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:51.759
industrial revolution, the people that

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:54.639
are most memorable, uh, like Leonardo da

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:57.920
Vinci, for example, did a lot of things.

00:15:54.639 --> 00:16:00.480
was an engineer, was an artist, was all

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.880
sorts of things, right? And the the kind

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.399
of elite education used to be about

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.079
understanding a lot of things about

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:08.000
spending a lot of time learning about

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:10.160
every everything. And I think this is

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.199
where the education needs to be headed

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.600
where the industrial revolution created

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:17.600
a world where humans are treated like

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.279
machines. If you think about

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.759
corporations or factories, factories are

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:25.920
one big machine and every individual

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:29.600
person kind of doing the assembly of one

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.519
thing is a part and I think it was very

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:35.120
dehumanizing and I think we're going to

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:36.639
go back to a to a moment of time uh

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.800
where there's a lot more opportunities

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:42.160
for entrepreneurship. Even when you join

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.759
a company, you're you're going to be

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.199
judged by how much of a real business

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:49.040
impact you're going to have as opposed

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:51.440
to how task oriented you are.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.399
>> The new AI age wants you to be what

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.720
researchers call a human epoch. Someone

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:59.759
who brings the five abilities AI still

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.959
can't replicate. Empathy, presence,

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:05.679
opinion or ethics, creativity, and hope

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:07.760
slash leadership. And these aren't soft

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:10.240
skills anymore. Let me give you a simple

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.959
example. Two people can both use chat

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:16.160
GPT to write a report, but only one of

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:18.880
them can walk into a meeting and read

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.039
the room, understand why a client is

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.199
nervous, understand what could be a

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:25.360
hesitation, reframe the problem when the

00:17:23.199 --> 00:17:28.079
model's answer isn't enough, make a

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:31.440
judgment call when the data conflicts,

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:34.320
inspire the team to move forward. That

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.880
combination, human psychology plus AI

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.120
fluency is what companies are paying a

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.919
premium for. And then there is something

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.280
most people still underestimate.

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:44.960
Personal brand.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.520
>> Personal brand is going to matter even

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.440
more, a lot more because personal brands

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.640
get 20 times the cut through as business

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.559
brands when you're trying to get

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.240
attention. But it's going to be nearly

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:56.720
impossible to build a personal brand.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.720
Imagine a scenario where there's an

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.480
airport and there are planes that are on

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.559
the ground and there are planes that are

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.200
already up in the air and the fog comes

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:07.120
rolling in and the air traffic control

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.520
says if you're already on the ground

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.880
it's too foggy you can't take off but if

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.039
you're up in the air you can keep

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.840
flying. That's what's going to happen to

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:17.840
personal brands. So new personal brands

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.320
are going to be harder and harder to get

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.400
through the fog. Existing personal

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.160
brands will be already up in the air. I

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.200
think there's probably two to three

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.120
years where you've still got time to

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.120
build a personal brand. I think one of

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.600
the greatest assets anyone can build

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.520
right now is a dedicated following of

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.600
two to 20,000 people who know who you

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.240
are. They they get you. Doesn't have to

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.760
be millions, but if there's 2 to 20,000

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.840
people out there on your LinkedIn, on

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.080
your Instagram, on your YouTube channel,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.440
whatever it is, they feel like they've

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.320
met you or know you, they've got a

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.160
parasocial relationship to you. If

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.520
you've got two to 20,000 people out

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.120
there who have that parasocial

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.880
relationship with you, that is going to

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.720
be one heck of an asset to have.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.679
>> In a world where AI can generate

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:04.320
infinite content, people follow people.

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:06.320
Your edge is a mix of AI fluency. You

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.039
know how to use tools better than 90% of

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.600
your peers. Polymath skills. You can

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:14.880
connect dots across fields and ship real

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.039
things. Personal brand. None of that

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.640
requires permission from a recruiter,

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:20.960
but it does require something

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.360
old-fashioned

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.160
learning. And no, we're not all about

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.640
retiring at 30, but how we work is

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.120
changing fast. Instagram co-founder Mike

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.520
Kger described it perfectly when he

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.559
talked about Claude and AI agents. What

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.919
do you think is going to happen in two

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:38.160
or three years? How we're going to

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:39.679
progress in advance? I think part of it

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.200
and I was having this conversation this

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:43.840
morning even with some of our our

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.880
researchers um the the progression or

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.360
the the dynamic that I see is um if last

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.520
year maybe the beginning of this year um

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.600
these models and I'll use Claude as the

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.120
example were really kind of uh

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.200
assistants that were helping you with

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.840
maybe a question at a time or maybe a

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.919
task right um this year they're moving

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.840
more into collaborators where um

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:05.760
especially if you watch somebody use um

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.360
cloud code for example they're actually

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.120
delegating what would have taken them

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.640
maybe 20, 30 minutes and Claude's going

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.640
off and doing it and then you're

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.360
checking in and you're more on the sort

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.799
of validating or verifying work, right?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.799
Going into next year, you're going to

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:20.799
delegate even bigger chunks of time or

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:22.880
even like pieces of the job out to that.

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:24.880
So, it's not just I have this very

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.400
specific thing, please go do it. And it

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.080
could be more sort of think of it,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.559
Claude, as something that's in the loop

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.400
of your business. So, hey Claude, um,

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:34.159
watch for any new user feedback and

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.840
maybe propose a change based on that.

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:37.760
And you can imagine evolving that. don't

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.360
just propose a change, write the code to

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.000
make the change and I'll check if it's a

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.679
good idea or not. Um, and then the next

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.679
step there is Claude actually being an

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:47.679
entire sort of co-orker where it has a

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:50.240
discipline. So, not just a project that

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:52.480
happens to be a good thought partner for

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.919
product management, but an actual

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.480
product manager in your company.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:58.640
>> This for me is the blueprint of AI proof

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.400
careers. You work with models that see

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.120
patterns better than any human ever

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.679
could, and you bring the things that

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.240
absolutely can't. judgment, taste,

00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:10.400
ethics, lived experience, emotional

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.280
support. In other words, you become the

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.760
translator between messy human reality

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.159
and superhuman AI systems. With all

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.720
these tools, it's natural to ask, do we

00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:23.679
even need formal education? I asked

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.480
Perplexity CEO Aravent if he'd still do

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:28.559
a PhD today. And what hit tell an

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.400
18-year-old starting from scratch.

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:33.039
>> The fundamental thing you learn in a PhD

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.720
is learning to learn. Like I I did a lot

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:37.280
of research in my PhD which doesn't

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.000
matter today but I got the ability to

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.679
like go learn a new topic dig deep

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.919
understand everything gather my

00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:46.240
information consult like whoever is the

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:47.360
best uh expert which by the way is not

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.080
needed anymore because you have tools

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.080
like perplexity subject expertise to go

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.679
make decisions and like you know branch

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:57.679
out that is what you acquire that skill

00:21:55.679 --> 00:22:00.480
zoom out and think beyond materialistic

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:02.480
goals like just foundationally as a

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.120
person you become a lot more grounded in

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.600
like the the willingness to seek truth,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.720
the relentless questioning, the socratic

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.600
method of learning uh and uh learning to

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.440
learn

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.520
>> uh and and and I feel like these three

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.159
qualities are like like reflective of

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:21.200
this proverb or phrase, right? Like give

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:22.880
a man a fish, you feed him for a day,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.720
teach a man to fish, you feed him for a

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.600
lifetime. Like that's how I feel about

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.720
PhD. So, no, you do not need a PhD to

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.280
succeed in AI. But you do need the thing

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.080
a good education was always supposed to

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.080
give you. The ability to learn fast, the

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.600
ability to ask better questions, to go

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.520
deep when everyone else is just

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.840
skimming. AI makes it easier than ever

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.400
to access knowledge. It does not replace

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.880
your responsibility to actually use it.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.240
So, let's put this all together. Yes,

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.880
entry-level jobs are disappearing. Yes,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.600
simple repeatable work is becoming less

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.440
valuable even if it's intellectual. The

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.360
people actually building this future

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.520
keep saying the same thing. This is both

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.360
the hardest and the best time to build

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.360
your career. If you want to be on the

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.200
winning side of this shift, here's a

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.360
simple plan you can start this month.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.320
Something real, something doable. Step

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.240
number one, learn to work with AI, not

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.720
around it. Write down the tasks you

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.120
repeat every week. Reports, re research,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.440
emails, content, and keep iterating.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.520
Don't stop there. Build AI workflows for

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.440
them using Chad GPT, Perplexity, Cloud.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.840
Keep trying those new tools. Your goal

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.240
is to cut the time in half for just

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.559
three to five tasks in the next 30 days

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.280
and put it into your CV or LinkedIn.

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:39.280
Reduced X task by 50% using AI

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.760
workflows. That's a language hiring

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.400
managers understand. Step number two, go

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.480
deep in one area. Then expand. Pick a

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.799
field and commit to one full year of

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.360
uncomfortable depth. courses, side

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:53.760
projects, real work you can show. After

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.320
that, add an adjacent skill. A marketer

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.240
who codes, a doctor who understands AI,

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.640
a designer who knows data. That's how

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.320
you go from task doer to someone who

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.240
actually moves the business. And then

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.400
step number three, build a small but

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.880
real personal brand. We've hired some

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.200
people recently and most of them came

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.200
because my COO followed them on

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.720
LinkedIn. She liked their way of

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.039
thinking. She liked their experience.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.279
She reached out on LinkedIn. We were not

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:21.440
chasing people with million followers,

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:23.760
just a couple thousand people who know

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.760
what you're good at. Post once or twice

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.600
a week about what you're learning,

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.919
building, and improving. Share

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.000
experiments, share case studies, and

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:34.720
numbers. Document the journey instead of

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.880
waiting to feel ready. So, to wrap this

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.600
up, the future work isn't humans versus

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.600
AI, it's humans plus AI. And the gap

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.000
between those who adapt and those who

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.760
don't is getting wider every month. If

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.240
you want me to break down specific AI

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.320
workflows for your job or industry, tell

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.400
me what you do in the comments. I might

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.559
make a whole video around it. And if

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.200
this helped you feel a little less

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:59.200
apocalypse and a little more okay, I

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.440
actually have a plan. Hit the like

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.840
button so that more people can see this

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.559
video. Your career is not over. It's

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:08.640
just in beta and you're the one shipping

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:10.480
the next version. Thank you so much and

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.039
I'll see you very soon on this channel.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.039
Bye.
