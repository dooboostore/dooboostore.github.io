00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:01.935
- Wow.

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.641
[background chatter]

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:05.474
[lips smacking]

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:08.400
- You look amazing. Do you, come in.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.233
- I know.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:10.713
- Wait, this, I'm actually,

00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:13.756
[laughing]

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:14.760
I have never seen you
in something like this

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.140
and I'm obsessed.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.973
- I know.
- Tell me

00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:17.806
everything about this.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.650
- I am actually obsessed
with this look too.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.770
So, I'm wearing a costume, Chanel.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.603
- [Emma] Amazing.

00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:26.640
- It's a beautiful black
jumpsuit underneath,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.725
if you could see it. [laughs]

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:29.280
- [Emma] Oh, a pant.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.113
- [Jennie] Mm-hmm.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.320
- [Emma] Zoom in on the pant.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.290
- Mm-hmm. And, the sculptural of a skirt

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.290
with these beautiful pearls,
and the hat, and the camellia.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.283
- It's-

00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:41.116
- I'm crying.

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:43.472
- Wait, the nails. Can we
zoom in on these nails?

00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:44.305
[Jennie gasps]
- Look,

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:46.860
a little charm like that. Okay.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.250
Tell me about, like, I don't
know, leading up to this week,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.300
how were you feeling?

00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:53.280
- [sighs] Honestly, it was a lot.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.280
I just came out of four
months of preparing Coachella

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.740
and I was back home for
a little bit and then,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.250
I knew the Met was happening,
so it was a lot for me

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.690
for the past couple months

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.280
and weeks.
- Doing Coachella

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.200
and then Met is a lot.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.040
- It's insane.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.530
- How are you, like, relaxing yourself

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.200
in between these really,
really intense moments?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.050
Like, what centers you,
what calms you down?

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.600
I've seen that you do,
wait, do you do ice baths?

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.650
- I love cold plunge

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.644
and ice baths.
- Okay,

00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:24.477
you love cold plunge.
- I do.

00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:25.620
- Have you been cold plunging?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.001
- I have actually.

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:27.834
- Really?

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:28.667
- I have. I cold plunge,

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:29.677
I love sauna.
- [Emma] Yep.

00:01:29.677 --> 00:01:33.450
- Those are the basic,
basic things that I do.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.620
And then, it was really good

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.940
to be back home for a little bit,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.773
honestly-
- [Emma] Yes.

00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:39.360
- ... to see my family and
my pet. I love my dog, so.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.650
- It's so important.
[Jennie laughs]

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.180
Well, you look beautiful.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.440
Whoa.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.330
Go have the most amazing night.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.782
You look so, I'm hugging you again.

00:01:46.782 --> 00:01:47.615
I love you.
- I know.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:48.540
I can't stop hugging you.
- I know.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.533
- You look so cute.

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.150
- And, like, the forbidden hug

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.830
because you're, like, looking so amazing.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.371
Don't let me ruin your
look. Go get after it.

00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:56.204
[lips smacking]
I'll see you in there.

00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:57.180
- I'll see you soon.
- [Emma] And, we'll have fun.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.923
I love you. Bye. [laughs]
