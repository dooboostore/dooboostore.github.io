00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:06.971
You wake up in a new world.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:11.108
Your eyes open
to bright, confusing lights.

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:14.845
Your ears are filled
with mysterious sounds.

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.015
Everything around you feels unfamiliar.

00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:21.552
This is a reality of a newborn baby.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.490
So what is it like to be a newborn?

00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:30.294
For a philosopher
and a psychologist like me,

00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:32.730
this is a fascinating question.

00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:37.635
It is hard enough to know
what's going on in adults' minds.

00:00:37.668 --> 00:00:41.338
What could be going on
in a newborn baby's mind?

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:45.376
Do babies have consciousness?

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.580
The subjective experience
of their mind and the world.

00:00:51.082 --> 00:00:55.052
In adults, consciousness
involves experiences

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:57.221
of seeing, hearing and thinking,

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.859
and feelings of pain,
pleasure and emotions.

00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:05.129
Do babies also have
this experience and feelings

00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:07.531
that light up their inner world?

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:13.404
So the traditional view is
that newborns are passive observers

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:15.673
of overwhelming chaos,

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:18.609
and they may not be conscious at all.

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:20.811
It sounds unbelievable today,

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:23.013
but 50 years ago,

00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:27.685
doctors routinely performed circumcision
without anaesthetic,

00:01:27.718 --> 00:01:31.655
convinced that newborns' immature brain
could not feel pain.

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:35.826
Since then, developmental psychologists

00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:39.897
have shown that infants' abilities
are much more complex

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.198
than we thought before.

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:47.004
But the question of infant consciousness
has remained open.

00:01:48.038 --> 00:01:53.644
One problem is that infants
cannot tell us how they feel.

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:56.547
They cannot describe their thoughts.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.184
And they certainly cannot
take a consciousness test.

00:02:00.217 --> 00:02:04.088
So how can we know
what's going on inside their minds?

00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:08.259
One answer is to measure infants' brains.

00:02:10.027 --> 00:02:12.029
Over the past few decades,

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.366
the science of consciousness
has told us a lot

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:18.369
about the brain basis
of consciousness in adults.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.940
We found neural signals
that are only active

00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:25.776
when an adult is consciously
perceiving a stimulus.

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.948
Recently, neuroscientists
found the same neural signals

00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:32.416
in infants' brains.

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:37.888
These provide powerful new evidence

00:02:37.922 --> 00:02:41.592
that infants might be
actively experiencing their surroundings

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.195
from a remarkably early age.

00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:49.967
One innovative experiment in neuroscience
is the audible paradigm.

00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:56.574
This is a test of how our brain reacts
when something unexpected happens.

00:02:56.574 --> 00:03:00.044
I love this paradigm,
and here’s how it works.

00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:04.448
Imagine repeatedly hearing

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:06.850
the same sequence of sounds.

00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:09.320
Beep, beep, beep, boop.
Beep, beep, beep, boop.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.588
Beep, beep, beep, boop.

00:03:10.621 --> 00:03:13.524
Suddenly, this familiar pattern

00:03:13.557 --> 00:03:16.193
is interrupted by a different sequence.

00:03:16.193 --> 00:03:17.595
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:21.966
Instantly, your brain
detects the surprise,

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:26.337
producing a measurable brain signal
called the P300 wave.

00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:31.942
This oddball response
to an expected sequence of sounds

00:03:31.942 --> 00:03:36.113
only happens when
an individual is conscious.

00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:40.150
People in deep sleep don't have it.

00:03:40.184 --> 00:03:42.386
People in comas don't have it.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.221
But newborn babies do.

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.858
The neuroscientist Ghislaine Dehaene

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:51.662
has found that when babies
are just a few days old,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.533
they show the same type of brain activity

00:03:56.533 --> 00:04:00.638
in response to this oddball
sequence of sounds.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.676
What this suggests
is that right from birth,

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.347
infants might be truly experiencing
conscious perceptions

00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:12.283
and conscious expectations.

00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:16.987
Researchers have also looked
for consciousness

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:21.091
through patterns
of attention in the brain.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:22.726
In conscious adults’ brains,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.964
different types of networks
alternate their activity

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:30.034
when we switch our attention
between the external world

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:32.002
and our internal thoughts.

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:33.404
You know how it is.

00:04:33.404 --> 00:04:35.806
You might be doing this right now.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:38.942
You focus your attention
on the speaker for a while,

00:04:38.942 --> 00:04:40.978
and then you daydream for a while.

00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:42.446
(Laughter)

00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:45.749
It turns out that infants
do the same sort of thing.

00:04:47.618 --> 00:04:50.421
The neuroscientist Lorina Naci

00:04:50.454 --> 00:04:54.191
recently observed
the same type of alternation

00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:57.594
between these networks in newborn brains.

00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:05.469
This suggests that these switches of focus
of internal and external awareness

00:05:05.502 --> 00:05:07.738
are present right from birth.

00:05:09.707 --> 00:05:14.278
There is also evidence
from gaps in attention.

00:05:14.278 --> 00:05:17.781
When our mind
intensely focuses on one thing,

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.355
it usually becomes blind to something
that happens immediately afterward.

00:05:24.388 --> 00:05:27.324
We call this phenomenon attentional blink.

00:05:28.392 --> 00:05:33.197
Infants experience this phenomenon too,
but in slow motion.

00:05:33.197 --> 00:05:34.832
At three months old,

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:38.402
infants take near a full second

00:05:38.402 --> 00:05:41.672
to shift their attention
from one visual cue to another,

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:46.276
compared to adults that can manage
this shift much faster.

00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:51.815
Amazingly, infants showing
the same type of brain response

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.317
when this happens

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.223
is strongly hinting they are actively
experiencing their environment.

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:04.762
Researchers have also found
relevant brain patterns

00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:07.598
in premature infants.

00:06:07.631 --> 00:06:09.366
Which makes you wonder,

00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:14.438
could consciousness begin before birth?

00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:16.507
This is a really important question.

00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:24.481
I told you all how scientists apply
the audible test to newborns.

00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:25.749
Well,

00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:28.452
they applied the same test

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:34.658
to late-term fetuses
around 35 weeks into pregnancy.

00:06:34.658 --> 00:06:36.493
The results were striking.

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:43.100
Fetus shows the same type
of brain response as we found in newborns.

00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:49.406
So even before birth
and entering the world,

00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:54.511
babies seem to be capable
of consciously processing sounds,

00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:58.415
meaning their awareness might develop
while they are still in the womb.

00:07:00.451 --> 00:07:05.189
Of course, these results
have potential implications

00:07:05.222 --> 00:07:08.759
scientifically, medically and ethically.

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:14.965
For a start, we now know
that when we perform surgery on newborns

00:07:14.998 --> 00:07:18.635
or premature infants
or late-term fetuses,

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.971
we should give them an anesthetic.

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.444
I know that many of you will be thinking
about the abortion debate.

00:07:27.444 --> 00:07:33.050
In that context, I should stress
that our strongest evidence

00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:37.354
is that consciousness
requires brain structures

00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:41.058
that emerge after 24 weeks of gestation,

00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:43.193
a time when abortion is rare.

00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:47.631
The new evidence
[that newborns are conscious]

00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:52.336
might extend to fetuses
in third trimester of gestation,

00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:54.705
but it doesn't extend
to earlier than that.

00:07:57.307 --> 00:07:59.576
This is a new understanding,

00:07:59.576 --> 00:08:02.546
and this new understanding
is a work in progress,

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:07.451
but might change our picture
of newborn babies.

00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:12.623
They are not passive creatures
waiting for consciousness to switch on.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.059
They are tiny humans

00:08:16.093 --> 00:08:17.761
already perceiving patterns

00:08:17.794 --> 00:08:21.298
and interacting with the world
in a meaningful way.

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:26.837
As human life unfolds,
consciousness unfolds with it.

00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:31.275
Our sense of ourselves grows and changes.

00:08:31.308 --> 00:08:35.279
Our consciousness waxes and wanes

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:38.015
until one day it ends.

00:08:41.084 --> 00:08:45.322
From the moment we take our first breath

00:08:45.322 --> 00:08:47.124
to the moment of our deaths,

00:08:48.058 --> 00:08:51.762
our lives are lit
by the flame of awareness.

00:08:51.795 --> 00:08:54.531
We share this flame with other animals

00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:58.235
and we might one day
share it with machines.

00:08:58.235 --> 00:09:03.874
Collectively, our conscious minds
illuminate the universe,

00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:08.512
and though each flame eventually fades,

00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:11.815
the light of consciousness
never disappears.

00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:15.552
It is rekindled with each new life

00:09:15.586 --> 00:09:18.755
in the endless dance of existence.

00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:20.057
Thank you.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.325
(Applause)
