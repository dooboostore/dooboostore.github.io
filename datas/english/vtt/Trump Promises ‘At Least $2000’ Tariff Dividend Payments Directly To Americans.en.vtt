00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.720
In a Sunday morning post on Truth

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.520
Social, President Donald Trump promised

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.440
to send at least $2,000 directly to

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.599
Americans using tariff revenue,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.320
promising to reward taxpayers and pay

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.480
off the US national debt. The post comes

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.480
just days after both conservative and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.800
liberal justices on the Supreme Court

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.039
scrutinized his administration's use of

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.920
the International Emergency Economic

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.160
Powers Act to impose the tariffs. In the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.800
post, Trump noted that the promised

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.680
$2,000 would not be issued to quote

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.760
unquote highincome people, but did not

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.399
provide details on what income level

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.879
would disqualify recipients or when and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.960
how the rebates would be sent. Trump

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.800
claimed the United States was quote

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.800
taking in trillions of dollars and will

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.680
soon begin paying down our enormous

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.199
debt, $37 trillion.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.239
The US raised about $195 billion in

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.000
tariff revenue during fiscal year 2025,

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.760
according to the Treasury Department

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.719
statement after the year ended in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.040
September. The Yale Budget Lab predicts

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:10.000
Trump's tariffs could raise as much as

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.080
$2.6 trillion between 2026 in 2035.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.280
But if the Supreme Court strikes down

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.159
his use of the EA, it could cut this

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.320
revenue down by more than 50%. Though

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.320
the administration has signaled it will

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.479
seek other legal methods to impose

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.280
tariffs even if the existing ones are

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.080
struck down. The US national debt is

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.400
over $ 38.1 trillion according to the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.960
Treasury Department's data. After

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.600
speaking on ABC Newses this week on

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.520
Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Besson

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.000
said he had not spoken to Trump about

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.240
sending a tariff dividend to Americans

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.720
and implied it might come instead in the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.119
form of tax decreases already promoted

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.320
as part of Trump's policy agenda.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.720
Bessant said, quote, "The $2,000

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.360
dividend could come in lots of forms and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.040
lots of ways. It could be just the tax

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.920
decreases that we are seeing on the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.799
president's agenda. you know, no tax on

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.520
tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.679
social security, deductibility of auto

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.599
loans. So, you know, those are

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.400
substantial deductions that, you know,

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.319
are being financed in the tax bill. This

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.280
is not the first time Trump has proposed

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.040
sending Americans cash based on tariffs,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.840
which threatens to raise prices for

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.239
consumers on imported goods. In July,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.200
Senator Josh Holly of Missouri sponsored

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.080
legislation to send $600 rebate checks

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.480
to Americans. Trump floated the idea in

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.080
October. For more on the story, check

description.
