00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.000
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. If

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.680
I could ask you to take your seats or if

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.160
you're not staying for this next

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.120
fantastic session on an honest

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.120
conversation about AI and humanity,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.480
please may I kindly request that you

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.320
leave the room quietly. I am delighted

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.519
to introduce this afternoon one of the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.920
world's leading authors, historians, and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.000
philosophers, Yuval Noah Harrari. He is

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.239
a distinguished research fellow at the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.200
University of Cambridge at the center

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.440
for the study of existential risk. He

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.239
has been a lecturer in the department of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.280
history at the Hebrew University of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
Jerusalem and he is co-founder of

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.640
Sapenship.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.000
As many of you will know, he is a

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.079
best-selling author of, amongst many

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.199
books, Sapiens, a brief history of

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.800
humankind, Homodus, Brief History of

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.920
Tomorrow, and 21 Lessons for the 21st

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.520
century, amongst others, selling over 50

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.080
million books worldwide in 65 languages.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.600
He focuses on the macrohistorical

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.760
questions of our time. And what a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.159
perfect moment with this pressing

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.799
arrival and disruption of AI to have

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.680
somebody of Yaval's distinction take on

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.479
this challenge. Please join me in warmly

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.560
welcoming Yuval Noah Harrari to deliver

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.560
a conversation about AI and humanity.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.600
So hello everyone.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.040
There is one question that every leader

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:53.680
today must answer about AI. But to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.719
understand that question, we first need

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:02.240
to clarify a few points about what AI is

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.719
and what AI can do.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.000
The most important thing to know about

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:14.400
AI is that it is not just another tool.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.040
It is an agent. It can learn and change

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.200
by itself and make decisions by itself.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.480
A knife is a tool. You can use a knife

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.160
to cut salad or to murder someone, but

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.520
it is your decision what to do with the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.040
knife.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.360
AI is a knife that can decide by itself

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.200
whether to cut salad or to commit

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.440
murder.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.319
The second thing to know about AI is

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.239
that it can be a very creative agent.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:57.040
AI is a knife that can invent new kinds

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:00.000
of knives as well as new kinds of music,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.200
medicine, and money.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.040
The third thing to know about AI is that

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.599
it can lie and manipulate.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.120
4 billion years of evolution have

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:17.920
demonstrated that anything that wants to

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.840
survive learns to lie and manipulate.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.080
The last four years have demonstrated

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:30.239
that AI agents can acquire the will to

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.360
survive and that AIs have already

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:39.120
learned how to lie.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:42.799
Now, one big open question about AI

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.519
is whether it can think.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.959
Modern philosophy began in the 17th

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.720
century when Rene Deart proclaimed I

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.680
think therefore I am.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.080
Even before the cult we humans defined

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:04.239
ourselves by our capacity to think. We

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:08.159
believe our we rule the world because we

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.159
can think better than anyone else on

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:14.239
this planet.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:18.400
Will AI challenge our supremacy in the

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:21.840
field of thinking? Now that depends on

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.160
what thinking means.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.560
Try to observe yourself thinking. What

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.240
is happening there?

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.440
Many people observe words popping in

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.040
their mind and forming sentences and the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:44.240
sentences then forming arguments like

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:48.960
all humans are mortal. I am human

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:53.440
therefore I am mortal.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.560
If thinking really means putting words

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.639
and other language tokens in order, then

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.000
AI can already think much better than

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.840
many many humans. AI can certainly come

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.280
up with a sentence like AI thinks,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.919
therefore AI.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.639
Some people argue that AI is just

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.320
glorified autocomplete. It barely

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.919
predicts the next word in a sent in a

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.400
sentence.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:29.759
But is that so different from what the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.840
human mind is doing?

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:37.440
Try to observe to catch the next word

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.199
that pops up in your mind. Do you really

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.000
know why you thought that word where it

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.520
came from? Why do you did you think this

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.360
particular word and not some other word?

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.759
Do you know? As far as putting words in

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.520
order is concerned,

00:05:53.759 --> 00:06:02.960
AI already thinks better than many of

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:08.960
us. Therefore, anything made of words

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:12.000
will be taken over by AI. If laws are

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.120
made of words, then AI will take over

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.880
the legal system. If books are just

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:22.720
combinations of words, then AI will take

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:27.440
over books. If religion is built from

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:30.479
words, then AI will take over religion.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.880
This is particularly true of religions

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:36.639
based on books like Islam, Christianity

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.039
or Judaism.

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.759
Judaism called itself the religion of

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:46.080
the book and it grants ultimate

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:50.400
authority not to humans but to words in

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:53.840
books. Humans have authority in Judaism

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:59.280
not because of our experiences but only

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:02.319
because we learn words in books. Now no

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.639
human can read and remember all the

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:09.360
words in all the Jewish books. But AI

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.400
can easily do that.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.960
What happens to a religion of the book

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.080
when the greatest expert on the holy

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.039
book is an AI?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:25.360
However, some some people may say, can

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:30.319
we really reduce human spirituality

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:34.160
to just words in books? Does thinking

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:36.479
mean only putting language tokens in

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.199
order?

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.840
If you observe yourself carefully when

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:44.479
you're thinking, you will notice that

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.479
something else is happening there

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:50.639
besides words popping in your mind and

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:55.039
forming sentences.

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:58.639
You also have some nonverbal feelings.

00:07:55.039 --> 00:08:01.759
Maybe you feel pain. Maybe you feel

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:04.639
fear. Maybe love.

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:08.879
Some thoughts are painful. Some are

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:11.840
frightening. Some are full of love.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:13.360
While AIs become better than us with

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.960
words,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:20.960
at least for now, we have zero evidence

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:24.560
that AIs can feel anything. Of course,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:30.080
because AI is mastering language,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.800
AI can pretend to feel pain or love. AI

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.880
can say, "I love you." And if you

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:40.240
challenge it to describe how love feels,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.880
AI can provide the best verbal

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.399
description in the world.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.959
AI can read countless love poems and

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:53.440
psychology books and can then describe

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:58.320
the feeling of love much better than any

00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.959
human poet, psychologist or lover. But

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.640
these are just words.

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:09.519
The Bible says in the beginning was the

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:12.800
word and the word was made flesh.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:16.640
The taqing says the truth that can be

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.680
expressed in words is not the absolute

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.880
truth. Throughout history, people have

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.920
always struggled with the tension

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.399
between word and flesh, between the

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.720
truth that can be expressed in words and

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:32.480
the absolute truth which is beyond

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.399
words.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:39.600
Previously this tension was internal to

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:43.839
humanity. It was between different human

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:47.279
groups. Some humans gave supreme

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:50.720
importance to words. They've been

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:55.040
willing, for example, to abandon or even

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:57.920
kill their gay son just because of a few

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.720
words in the Bible.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:04.959
Other humans have said, "But these are

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:07.600
just words. The spirit of love should be

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:09.519
much more important than the letter of

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.160
the law."

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:15.440
This tension between spirit and letter

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.880
existed in every religion, every legal

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:23.760
system, even every person.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:26.000
Now this tension will be externalized.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.959
It will become the tension not between

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.480
different humans. It this will be the

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:35.680
tension

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:40.720
between humans and AIs, the new masters

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:44.480
of words. Everything made of words will

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:48.079
be taken over by AI.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:52.160
Previously all the words, all our verbal

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:56.079
thoughts, they originated in some human

00:10:52.160 --> 00:11:00.320
mind. Either my mind I thought this or I

00:10:56.079 --> 00:11:03.519
learned it from another human. Soon most

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.800
of the words in our minds will originate

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:10.959
in a machine. I just heard today about a

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.839
new word that AIS coined by themselves

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:17.839
to describe us humans.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:21.760
They called us the watchers.

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:25.760
The watchers that we are watching them.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:29.519
AIS will soon be the origin of maybe

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:32.959
most of the words in our minds.

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:35.600
AIS will mass prodduce thoughts by

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:38.160
assembling words, symbols, images, and

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.160
other language tokens into new

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.320
combinations.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.519
Whether humans will still have a place

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:49.600
in that world depends on the place we

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:52.800
assign our nonverbal feelings and our

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:56.160
ability to embody wisdom that cannot be

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:59.200
expressed in words. If we continue to

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:04.480
define ourselves by our ability to think

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:07.440
in words, our identity will collapse.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.399
All this means that no matter from which

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:15.040
country you come, your country will soon

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:18.720
face a severe identity crisis and also

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:21.760
an immigration crisis.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.920
The immigrants this time will not be

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.240
human beings coming in fragile boats

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.320
without a visa or trying to cross a

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.399
border in the middle of the night. The

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:35.680
immigrants will be millions of AIs that

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:38.480
can ride love poles better than us, that

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.959
can lie better than us, and that can

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.600
travel at the speed of light without any

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:46.000
need of visas.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.320
Like human immigrants, these AI

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.920
immigrants will bring various benefits

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.560
with them. We will have AI doctors to

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.040
help in our health care systems, AI

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:01.760
teachers to help in our education

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:06.160
systems, even AI border guards to stop

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:09.440
illegal human immigrants. But the AI

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.040
immigrants will also bring with them

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.120
problems.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.880
Those who are concerned about human

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:20.399
immigrants usually argue that immigrants

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:24.160
might take jobs, might change the local

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:26.639
culture, might be politically disloyal.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.079
I'm not sure that's true of all human

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:33.279
immigrants, but it will definitely be

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:35.920
true of the AI immigrants.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:39.920
The AI immigrants will take many human

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:42.639
jobs. The AI immigrants will completely

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.680
change the culture of every country.

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:48.880
They will change out religion and even

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.519
romance. Some people don't like it if

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.399
their son or daughter is dating an

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:57.120
immigrant boyfriend. What would these

00:13:54.399 --> 00:14:01.680
people think when their son or daughter

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:03.680
starts dating an AI boyfriend?

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.880
And of course, the AI immigrants will

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.440
have some dubious political loyalties.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.160
They are likely to be loyal not to your

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.399
country but but to some corporation

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:18.639
government across the ocean most

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:21.760
probably in one of only two countries

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:24.320
China or the USA.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:27.120
The USA encourages countries to close

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:32.000
their borders to human immigrants but

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.760
open them very very wide to USA

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.279
immigrants.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.079
And now we can finally come to the

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:39.760
question each one of you must soon

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:44.000
answer.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:48.959
Will your country recognize the AI

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.320
immigrants as legal persons?

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:55.120
AIS are obviously not persons. They

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.680
don't have a body or a mind. But a legal

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.279
person is something quite different from

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.639
a person.

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:05.600
A legal person is an entity that the law

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:08.959
recognizes as having certain legal

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.760
obligations and rights. For example, the

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:15.600
right to hold property, to file a

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:18.480
lawsuit, and to enjoy freedom of speech.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.680
In many countries, corporations are

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.880
considered legal persons. The Alphabet

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:28.160
Corporation can open a bank account, can

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.519
sue you in court, or can donate to your

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.160
next presidential campaign.

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:37.839
In New Zealand, rivers have been

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.720
recognized as legal persons. In India,

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:45.040
certain gods have been granted such

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:48.800
recognition. Of course, until today,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:52.880
recognizing a corporation, a river, or a

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.480
god as a legal person was just legal

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.040
fiction.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:00.160
In practice, if a corporation like

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:04.720
Alphabet decided to buy another

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:07.680
corporation or if a Hindu god, [cough]

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.240
if a Hindu god decided to sue you in

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.839
court, the decision wasn't really made

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:17.680
by the god. It was made by some human

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:21.920
executives, shareholders or trustees.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:25.839
It is different with AIS. Unlike rivers

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:28.959
and gods, AIs can actually make

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:30.639
decisions by themselves.

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:32.880
They will soon be able to make the

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:36.480
decisions necessary to manage a bank

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:40.000
account, to file a lawsuit, and even to

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:43.279
operate a corporation without any need

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.800
of human executives, shareholders or

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:48.800
trustees.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:52.639
AIS can therefore function as persons.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:57.920
Do we want to allow that? Will your

00:16:52.639 --> 00:17:01.360
country recognize AIS as legal persons?

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.920
What if other countries do it?

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:08.319
Suppose your country doesn't want to

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:10.559
recognize AIS as persons. But the USA in

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:13.679
the name of deregulating AI and

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:16.319
deregulating the markets grants legal

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:19.039
recognition, legal personhood to

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:22.720
millions of AIs which start running

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:26.959
millions of new corporations.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:30.320
Will you block these USAI corporations

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:34.400
from operating in your country?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.600
Suppose some USI persons invent super

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:40.240
efficient and super complex financial

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.720
devices that humans cannot fully

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.600
understand and therefore don't know how

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:49.200
to regulate. Will you open your

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:52.799
financial markets to this new AI

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:56.799
financial wizardry or will you try to

00:17:52.799 --> 00:18:00.480
block it thereby decoupling from the

00:17:56.799 --> 00:18:03.440
American financial system?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.080
Suppose some AI persons create a new

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.559
religion which gains the faith of

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:12.000
millions of people. That should not

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:14.880
sound too far-fetched because after all,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
almost all previous religions in history

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.600
have claimed that they were created by a

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.280
nonhuman intelligence. Now, will your

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:29.039
country extend freedom of religion to

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.919
the new AI sect and to its AI priests

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:33.600
and missionaries?

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:37.360
Maybe we should start with something a

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:40.960
bit simpler. Will your country allow AI

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:43.919
persons to open social media accounts,

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:48.080
enjoy freedom of speech on Facebook, on

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:50.000
Tik Tok and befriendly children?

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.520
Well, of course, that question should

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.280
have been asked 10 years ago. On social

00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:00.400
media, AI bots have been operating as

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:04.880
functional persons for at least a

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:07.840
decade. If you think AIS should not be

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:11.760
treated as persons on social media, you

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:14.720
should have acted 10 years ago.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:18.000
10 years from now, it will be too late

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:20.400
for you to decide whether AIs should

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.400
function as persons in the financial

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:27.600
markets, in the courts, in the churches.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:30.160
Somebody else will already have decided

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.919
it for you.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.120
If you want to influence where humanity

00:19:31.919 --> 00:19:36.720
is going, you need to make a decision

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.640
now.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:43.760
So what is your answer as a leader? Do

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:49.360
you think the AI immigrants should be

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:52.559
recognized as legal persons? If not, how

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:57.640
are you going to stop that?

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:57.640
Thank you for listening to this human.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.799
Thank you, Yaval. That was fantastic

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.720
overview. You posed a lot of questions

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:15.039
um and they're the right ones. I agree

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.760
with much of what you say. We're here in

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:20.559
Davos where the theme is around dialogue

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.880
and I was struck by your commentary

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:25.039
around words and the importance of words

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.440
and that being something that demarcates

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:29.039
human animals from other animals

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.760
although that's debatable that there's

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:35.600
other language there. So in the context

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:38.080
of Davos and the range of people we have

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.960
here from technology from the business

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.600
world from politicians

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.679
>> how would you like to see what is the

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.000
answer that you have in terms of this

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:50.720
slightly dystopian world you've

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.200
potentially put in front of us

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.200
>> and if I may just add to that I think

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.240
it's fair to say I'm a scientist by

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.000
background a neuroscientist so I uh work

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.720
a lot in this space particularly around

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.240
pain and we're very comfortable with the

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.559
fact that many of our discoveries

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.280
particularly technological discoveries

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:11.520
we often drive them forward and then

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.960
afterwards we think oh we hadn't thought

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.640
enough about the ethics and the

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.720
implications and then we're trying to

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.480
catch up on the regulation that we need

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.400
to maybe put around it

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.559
>> so we are where we are this thing is

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.320
happening as everybody says at scale

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:26.080
both in terms of its magnitude and its

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.159
pace more than we've ever seen before in

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.320
the industrial revolution we have all

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:32.720
the right blend of people here in Davos,

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.600
it's all about dialogue. What would you

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.440
like to see go forward in terms of

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.360
putting boundaries around some of the

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.159
slightly more worrying areas that you

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.640
detailed? And what are your own thoughts

00:21:42.159 --> 00:21:47.840
about the ethical implications of giving

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.919
legal rights to either agents to robots

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.080
or to the ones that just exist on the

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:54.320
internet?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.880
>> A lot of things there. I mean, first of

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.720
all, I I would say that no, Davos is

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.520
about words.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.919
It's about talking. The basic idea of

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.720
Davos is that you can change the world

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:08.480
just by talking. Which I like this idea

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.960
because this is also my idea as an

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.600
author, as a university lecturer. This

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.559
is what I do. I talk, I write. I think I

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.559
can influence the world the world with

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:22.400
words.

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:26.880
Um, and this is now in in question. Are

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:30.400
we at the end of the road for words?

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.400
um is this no longer a function?

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:36.000
And

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:38.880
you know engineers and also soldiers

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.360
they don't change the world with words

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.760
they do stuff they take action.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.520
Um philosophers,

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:52.159
scholars also political leaders

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.600
they try to change the world with words

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:58.559
by saying things. And maybe we've

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.960
reached the end of that road. And what

00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:05.360
does it mean that we know we we humans

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:08.559
we conquer the world ultimately I would

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:11.039
say with language and words because yes

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:13.600
engineers can make weapons and soldiers

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:15.760
can wield them. But to build an army you

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.159
need to convince thousands of strangers

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:23.600
to cooperate. How do you do that? With

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:25.919
words, with ideology, with religion.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.720
So, humans took over the world not

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:31.600
because we are the strongest physically,

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:35.360
but because we discovered how to use

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:39.520
words to get thousands and millions and

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.919
billions of strangers to cooperate.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.400
This was our superpower. And now

00:23:41.919 --> 00:23:49.039
something has emerged that is going to

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:52.799
take our superpower from us. Until a few

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:55.679
years ago, nothing on earth could use

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:58.000
words. Only humans, chimpanzees

00:23:55.679 --> 00:24:00.799
couldn't, rivers couldn't, the sun

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.360
couldn't, we could use words.

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:05.440
Now there is something that is able or

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.840
soon will be able to use words better

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.720
than us. And you look just, you know, at

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.480
what happened on social media and the

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.080
immense change it brought to the world

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.480
there.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:22.640
So 10 years from now, living in a world

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:25.039
in which AIs are in command of language,

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.279
how does that look like?

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:29.279
>> Well, Davos in 10 years might look very

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:30.960
different as you say. So that's a future

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:33.440
we can all try to think about in the

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.799
context of who would be here beyond the

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.960
physical human. But if I may just um

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:42.960
discuss a little bit around the fact

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:45.360
that it's not new for humans to be uh

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.279
beaten by technology. So if we think

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.679
about some of the tech, we can't fly and

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:51.679
we built airplanes. Cars can go faster

00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:54.000
than us. We're very comfortable with

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:55.840
that. The threat that comes with AI is

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.640
the fact that it's a threat to the

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.880
sovereign power of our ability to think.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.039
And that is destabilizing. I say that as

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.600
an academic and an educator. That's

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:08.480
something that is very threatening. But

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.159
if we go back to say a robot, the value

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.480
we would place on a robot being able to

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:14.720
run the 100 meters faster than Usain

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.960
Bolt is less. There's something about

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.200
the human endeavor, the struggle, the

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.799
suffering, the fact that we can have a

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.480
collective sense of empathy and

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:23.919
understanding about what it meant to

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.720
achieve something, even if it was

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:28.720
lesser, with technology. I just wonder

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.360
whether an author that would replace

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.919
you, how much as a human we would value

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.240
that the words of that the creativity

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:37.440
that comes from art that's been done

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.760
with artificial intelligence

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.440
>> if do you think we will value it as much

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.760
and therefore there's still a place for

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.400
humans in the creative space of thinking

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.640
and words

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.559
>> that's the identity crisis because the

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:54.320
cow didn't say I run therefore I am

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:57.919
>> I think I mean it based human identity

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:00.559
on our capacity to think. We always knew

00:25:57.919 --> 00:26:02.640
that cheetahs can run faster than us. We

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:05.039
always knew that elephants are much

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.120
bigger and stronger than us. So we

00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:10.720
didn't define ourselves by this. We

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:14.080
define ourselves by thinking. And now

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:17.120
something is going to be better than us

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.279
in thinking if thinking means putting

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.120
words in order. Now I'm again I'm an

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:23.039
author. I'm a speaker. I put words in

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.200
order. This is like this is my game.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:26.720
Like I have all these words and I put oh

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.080
let's put these words in this in this

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.600
order. No no no no no no. It will be

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.120
better to put it like this like this

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.960
like this and AI will beat me. I don't

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.640
know how long it will take two years 5

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.360
years 10 years it will beat me and then

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.279
what does it mean for our identity?

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.640
People identify you know with the

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:48.320
streams of of words in in in their mind

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.559
like you close your eyes you try to see

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.360
what's happening inside me. Many people,

00:26:50.559 --> 00:26:55.679
I'm one of them, we see words popping

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.960
up, organizing themselves. We identify

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:58.880
with that.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.279
>> But I guess my point is using the same

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.720
analogy is that we still value a human.

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:04.159
We have the Olympics. We've got the

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.240
Winter Olympics coming.

00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:08.480
>> We know that many other animals and

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.799
other technologies can outperform in

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:14.000
many of those areas. Yet, we still

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:15.679
really enjoy the humanity of people that

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
train and develop even though it's not

00:27:15.679 --> 00:27:20.080
as good. And I just wonder whether we

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.159
will just naturally extend that to the

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.799
thinking realm and to the word so that

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:26.640
you still will have a very very vibrant

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:27.200
and successful author role in 10 years

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.720
time and

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.320
>> I don't know like

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.600
>> because I will value your book more than

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.480
an AI generated book

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.720
>> even if even if the AI comes up with new

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.039
ideas better than me like let's say that

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:42.799
you want to invest money and you have a

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:45.200
you ask a human consultant and she comes

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:47.440
up with a certain whatever and you can

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.200
empathize with her because she had this

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.000
life story and whatever and then you

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.960
have the AI financial consultant with

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.679
zero life story, zero emotions but

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.919
better financial advice.

00:27:57.679 --> 00:28:01.840
Which one will you follow?

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:03.919
>> Now we always have this kind of I think

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.320
the bigger mistake and this is why I

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:10.480
started with the idea of agency. We

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:12.880
always think that uh um we can just use

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.279
these things as tools.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.559
>> But if they can think

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:18.640
>> they are agents.

00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:21.600
>> Yeah. You know, maybe I I'll tell a

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.200
story from medieval history that how did

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.880
the Anglo-Saxons

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:30.320
took over Britain and it's part myth

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:32.880
about history that you know the Britain

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.120
who lived there originally they were

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.360
fighting with the PS and the Scots

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.000
coming from the north and the Britain

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.320
didn't fight very well. So the king of

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.399
the Britain, Vodiger, he said, "I have

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.559
an idea. I've heard that in Germany, in

00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:48.880
Scandinavia, these people really know

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:51.840
how to fight. So let's bring over some

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.000
mercenary, some Anglo-Saxon mercenary.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.640
They will fight for us. They will defeat

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.600
the picss and the Scots." And Vodig

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.840
brings over Anglo-Saxon mercenaries and

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.760
they fight well and they defeat the

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.000
Scots and the picss. But then the

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.399
Anglo-Saxons says say to themselves this

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.640
is a rich country and these people they

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:13.360
are very weak and these people they are

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:17.039
disunited we can take over

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.880
>> and they take over. We understand this

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:20.799
with human mercenaries.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.840
>> We understand that when you bring a

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:26.159
human mercenary okay you pay them but

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.159
they have a mind of their own maybe they

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:31.120
rebel.

00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:32.960
>> We don't get it with AIS.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.679
>> Yeah. You know, you look at the leader

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:39.120
of of the world, they think, "Oh, I'll

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:41.919
bring AI to fight my war for me."

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.880
The idea that it can just take power

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:43.360
away from me.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.600
>> Yeah.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:49.360
>> It doesn't really cross their mind. They

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:51.360
don't really accept that AIS can think.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.279
>> Yeah. Yeah. And that is very

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.880
fundamentally different. So, just to

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:57.520
reverse that, you're an alum of my

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.360
institution. Uh, and and we're proud of

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.919
that. Um, although you're working at the

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.279
other place now in Cambridge. Um so the

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:06.159
challenge I think for the education

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:08.399
sector and it goes back to a reverse

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:10.320
flip of what Alan Turing said which was

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:12.159
whether a computer could think the sort

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.000
of birthplace of of artificial

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:15.520
intelligence if you will. So I think the

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.320
question we've been posing inside the

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.880
academic sector is how do we keep humans

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:23.360
thinking because if we keep abdicating

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.440
our decision making our financial

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.840
decisions or whatever it might be

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.440
increasingly increasingly to AI the

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.799
worry we have quite quickly and we're

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.880
seeing this with students coming to us

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:35.840
through the school system very overusing

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:38.559
chat GPT is the deskilling of critical

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:41.279
faculties of human brain thinking. So

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:44.000
what's your advice to me in the academic

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:46.399
sector about how can we hang in there as

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.200
humans and keep humans thinking so that

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:50.960
we at least have some capacity to live

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.039
alongside these technologies which as

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.200
you say bring us into a very different

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:55.919
place going forward in terms of world

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.480
order.

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:59.840
>> You know at the present moment we still

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.679
think better.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.520
>> So at the present moment it's kind of

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:05.760
telling people you you need your

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.440
critical thinking, you need moral

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.320
evaluations. You cannot get that from

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.720
AI. But we need to prepare to the moment

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.480
when this is no longer the case. We need

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.960
to prepare for the moment. Let's say

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:22.080
again take economics or finance when AI

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.320
create a new financial systems a new

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.120
financial system that they understand

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:30.960
and we don't understand. How do you

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:33.919
train economists or politicians in a

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.200
world in which humans really can't can

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:40.880
no longer understand how finance

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:44.000
functions because AIs have created this

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.720
super complex financial system that we

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.880
are like the horses you know that horses

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.120
can see that they are being traded from

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.279
one human to another for a few shiny

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.840
gold coins they can't understand this

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:58.399
idea of money too complicated

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:01.600
We can be in the same situation 10 years

00:31:58.399 --> 00:32:04.399
from now. Davos 10 years from now.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.360
>> Maybe nobody in the room, no human in

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:10.559
the room understands the financial

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:14.240
system anymore because it's dominated by

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:17.279
AIs and the AIs have come up with new

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.840
financial strategies and devices

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:22.720
that are just mathematically beyond the

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.919
human capacity of of the brain. So how

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:29.360
does politics and finance and davos look

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:31.200
like in a world when no human beings

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.440
understands finance anymore?

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.200
>> Yeah. No. Well, that's a beautiful note

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.480
to finish on. We've run out of time.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.480
There are many more questions that we

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.519
could explore. One of which just being

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:43.360
the major difference uh that we know

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:45.120
about artificial intelligence compared

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.559
to human intelligence is of course the

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.279
human brain develops from birth to

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:51.200
adulthood around age 20. And it is a

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:53.840
product of your life experience as a

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.960
sentient human being feeling loving

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.320
anger these emotions. And whilst one can

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.000
improvise a little bit with sensory

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.480
detectors and you can train the brain to

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.320
do that that is fundamentally different.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.919
So the artificial brain is not a human

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.960
brain. It is not human. And there is

00:33:05.919 --> 00:33:11.039
maybe something that is still of value

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.200
there that goes back to that core

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:15.279
business of this sentient human being

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.200
that brings value to our understanding.

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:17.919
And maybe one last comment.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.360
>> Please

00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:24.720
>> think about educating kids in a world

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:28.000
where from day zero maybe the most of

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.039
the interaction of the new child is with

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.559
an AI. Yeah.

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:30.880
>> And not with a human being.

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.880
>> Yeah.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.360
>> It's the biggest and scariest

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.720
psychological experiment in history and

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.440
we are conducting it.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.880
>> Indeed, we are. Well, you thank you so

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.480
much. I'm delighted that you're thinking

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.480
about these problems and that you've got

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.919
us all thinking this afternoon. I look

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.799
forward to you coming back maybe to

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:50.799
Davos in in uh 10 years and reflecting

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:52.320
on this conversation and just where we

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:53.679
have got to. But thank you all to the

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.960
audience, those of you online and those

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:58.360
in the group. And thank you. Can we give

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.360
a round of applause?
