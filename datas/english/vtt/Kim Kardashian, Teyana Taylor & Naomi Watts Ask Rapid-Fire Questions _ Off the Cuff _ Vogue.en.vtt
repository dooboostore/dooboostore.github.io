00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.080
Is it Is it me or something?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.319
>> Stop.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.040
>> Just like Santa.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.720
>> Just like

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.840
>> I have no recollection. This is

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.000
humiliating.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.040
>> Hi Vogue. It's Kim,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.920
>> Tiana,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.679
>> Naomi.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.520
>> Just some of the cast of All's Fair and

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.160
we're going to play a game of off the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.800
cuff.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.240
>> Oo. Shelly. Round one.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.800
>> Ice breakers. What's your favorite word?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.320
>> My favorite word is hydration.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.960
>> Really?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.240
experience.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.520
>> I dream.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.480
>> I think mine must be beauty.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.200
>> Shut up.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.600
>> You know, everywhere I turn

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.559
my favorite word is love.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.280
>> I love love. I love love so much.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.800
>> That's a good one.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.719
>> What's a sound you love?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.520
>> Think like meditation sounds like water

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.000
on a tin roof. I love things.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.680
>> Yeah.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.640
>> All right. What's your least favorite

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.719
word?

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.920
>> Hate. If you went with love, we'll do

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.800
the opposite of hate.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
>> I love hate.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.559
>> Yeah. Moist.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.159
>> Yeah. That's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.080
>> It just sounds rude.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.960
>> So it sounds rude to say that cake is

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.760
moist.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.119
>> Yeah. Well,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.080
>> you you know what's crazy now as you say

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.340
it's like moist.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.360
>> It's hydrated.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.000
[Laughter]

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400
>> Yeah. It just sounds pornographic.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.960
>> Okay. Round two. Getting personal.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.720
>> Ooh.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.320
>> What's something you have to have with

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.280
you wherever you go?

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.280
>> My phone case. My phone case is a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.920
wallet. Phone case. Hold some credit

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.600
cards, your wallet, and pictures of my

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.280
babies. A little bit of everything. I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.640
don't like carrying purses. Your screen

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.960
saver right now. Right now.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.840
>> I have the coolest screen saver. So, I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.200
have, if you have an iPhone, you can tap

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.200
it 50 times and upload 50 pictures. So,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.240
my kids I'll show you guys. Each kid

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.040
gets a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.720
>> a little moment.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.520
>> And so, they come up to my phone and

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.439
they tap it so to make themselves the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.759
screen. Seems like I only have my boys.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.840
I have to get to one girl. There we go.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.520
They come up to my phone. No one gets

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.920
left out. What's your guilty pleasure?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.439
>> Mine's just watching Love Island. They

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.720
could never make enough seasons of that.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.560
>> I love

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.319
>> I've watched every country and I've

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.800
watched it through every subtitle.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.480
>> Really?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.160
>> Yes. Cuz I just love it so much.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.319
>> No, this pass on was actually my first

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.800
time ever seeing it. But the moment I

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.239
put it on, it was just me and my mumu

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.680
and Love Island. Yes.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.200
>> Imagine you in a mumu.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.599
>> I can't either. I'm in my mu just made

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.120
these two and I I'm going to bring them

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.920
tomorrow cuz I'm like I want

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.800
>> That's like a mumu right now.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.840
>> Super cool though.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.760
>> I'm in my mu.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.040
>> Yeah, for real. Moo with no draws.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.120
>> It's too free under there.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.360
>> Moo with no drawers. I love it. Free

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.360
under there,

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.000
>> you know. And then when you walk, you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.239
go.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.239
>> Okay. I I have a a question. If you

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.360
could go back in time and relive a

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.360
moment of your life, what would that be?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.519
>> Oh, mine's easy. Just any time with my

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.080
dad. Like a childhood, I'd say.

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.560
>> Yeah.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.640
>> 7 years old was the golden years when my

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.480
mom and dad were together.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.640
>> Time just keep going and we're all

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.640
getting older. I think going back to the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.159
times where like my babies were like

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.680
small enough for me to just hold them

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.120
and love on them like when they could

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.120
not like all right mom okay mom you know

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.040
almost like when they couldn't talk

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.640
>> and I'm sure when they like oh my god

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400
this lady always kissing me she's just

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.319
all up on me but just like

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.560
>> that stage where you could just like

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.440
>> get squishy and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.640
>> for me I'm going to say echo what Kim

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.200
said because I lost my dad young and I

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.959
have really no memories face.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.080
>> It just feels sad.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.879
>> How old were you?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.440
>> Seven.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.000
>> Oh, wow. And I said seven randomly.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.319
>> Yeah.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
>> Maybe I would wish like old enough to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.799
have a great conversation.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.680
>> Yeah.

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.440
>> Yeah. If you were a lawyer, what type of

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.879
law would you practice?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.760
>> Maybe I'd be like an entertainment

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.239
lawyer.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.920
>> Hey. Hey.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.560
>> Oh, yeah. I've I love my entertainment

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.920
lawyer. I mean, maybe civil liberties or

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.360
defense attorney.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.319
>> I like that, too, cuz I'm like a great

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.760
debater.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.760
>> You know what I'm saying? Stop.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.280
>> I don't know. Trial court. Yeah.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.560
>> Where were you?

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.760
>> Yeah.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.360
>> Judge, he's lying.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.440
>> Okay. Round three. What are some

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.720
surprising things you did to prepare for

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.639
your role?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.240
>> I mean, this was like

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.720
>> You're just a legend. You don't need

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.080
>> No, no. I I take preparation very

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.880
seriously. I

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.199
>> being amazing.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.800
>> But in this case, it was just like, you

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.400
know, other than learning the lawyer

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.320
speak, which don't ask me now because

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.360
I've forgotten everything. We rely on

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.320
you, Kim. I think mine was like

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.880
preparing myself to shut up, you know,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.840
like I I usually get like these loud

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.080
complex characters, you know, and Milan

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.639
is a lot more like shy and

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.520
>> right,

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.440
>> but it's weird because like in real life

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.280
I get very very shy. So I was able to

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.120
pull from like some of my real life

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.199
experiences to kind of be like, oh, I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.040
kind of get to show this side and show

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.440
my range. So it was it was fun preparing

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.400
for Milan. What's the spiciest message

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.880
you received or sent in the All's fair

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.000
group text chat

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.000
>> yesterday?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.199
>> There's a lot of vagina talk, ladies.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.680
>> A lot of vagina talk. And Ryan is like a

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.680
dear.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.800
>> He's got a front row seat in that chat.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.440
>> Yes. Round four, fashion questions.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.120
>> Oo.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.880
>> What's a garment from the show you wish

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.600
you could have taken home?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.080
>> Everything.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.880
>> Yeah. I I'm I had a lot of suits I

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.160
wanted to hold on to, but I'm I'm I've

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.039
got such a shoe thing.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.520
>> My favorite was that threepiece suit,

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.840
the cream with the vest cream.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.840
>> Love that. And you and Rick Owens.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.560
>> Yes, you love you some Rick. Love me

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.080
some Rick.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.080
>> I

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.000
kept everything.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.639
>> It's It's a lot of it was mostly from my

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.240
wardrobe.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.560
>> Well, that was my next question, which

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.320
is how much input did you have in your

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.240
character's costume? And you just

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.080
>> I This is like Well, I was going to say

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.160
this is the first time. This is my first

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.720
show. So, this is Yeah.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.639
>> But I I it was really important to me

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.280
and to Ryan mostly. He wanted me to like

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.319
just be a very certain specific way from

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.639
the hair of like having shorter hair to

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.360
the wardrobe. So, pulling it from my

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.520
closet was really fun and crazy. What's

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.400
a red carpet look you wore that was

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.120
polarizing but that you will defend

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.039
until the

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.960
>> Oh, okay. Here I've got an answer for

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.759
this one. Um, it was to the friend

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.120
premiere, a film I did with Bill Murray

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:37.840
and a dog, a gigantic Great Dane, and I

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.560
wore this outfit that matched the dog.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.240
And I was definitely like debating this

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.479
with my stylist, and she was like, "Go

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.680
on, it's so cool." It's it was by

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:51.039
jackamus and it was black and white and
