WEBVTT

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.560
Let's start with you Elon if you don't

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.440
mind Jensen feel free to chive in you

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.559
have a big fascination of something all

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.679
of us have admired first order thinking

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.160
for how you have dropped the cost of

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.840
batteries from a thousand for kilowatt

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.279
hour to subund bucks and right now

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.680
you're doing the same thing with

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.960
robotics for actuators with servo rotors

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.960
and motors so I want to hear from you

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.520
how do you manage manage to always

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.360
disrupt every single industry with that

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.480
thinking.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:44.000
>> Well, it's mostly not disruption, it's

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.160
creation. So, with uh say SpaceX with

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.760
reusable rockets, uh there really

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.960
weren't any reusable rockets. Um

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.640
but the essence of getting

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.559
of revolutionizing space travel is

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.960
reusability. If you throw the rocket

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.320
away every time, the cost of access to

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.040
space is extremely high. Um, with

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.880
respect to electric cars, there there

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.640
weren't any electric cars when we

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.760
started making them really. You couldn't

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680
buy any to the best of my knowledge. Um,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.840
so with Tesla, we wanted to make

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.600
electric cars compelling um, and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.280
affordable. That was the goal. Um the uh

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.840
you know with respect to humanoid

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.400
robotics there are no useful humanoid

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.080
robotic robots at this point. Um there

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.040
are sort of gimmicks but there are there

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.040
are no actually useful humanoid robots.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.520
Um and I think Tesla's going to make the

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.680
first actually useful humanoid robots.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.600
Um and this will be quite a revolution

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.159
and I think something that will that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.240
everyone will want. Uh because I always

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.399
think of like who who wouldn't want

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.720
their own personal C3PO R2-D2. Oh yeah,

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.200
>> of course everyone would want one,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.600
right? And and then there would be many

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.600
in industry uh providing products and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.040
services. This is why I say that

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.680
humanoid robots will be the biggest

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.159
industry or the biggest product ever.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.240
Um, bigger than cell phones or anything

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.959
else because everyone's going to want

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.440
one and uh or maybe more more than one

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.080
and there'll be many in industry and and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.080
you know people often talk about uh sort

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.640
of eliminating poverty and that kind of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.720
thing but really the there's how long

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.040
have they been talking about that? Um

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280
there's lots of talk uh you know there's

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.160
lots of NOS's sort of trying to do these

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.720
things but but really not succeeding um

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.239
and and and you know the evidence speaks

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.959
for itself. U but but but AI and

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.120
humanoid robots will actually eliminate

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.239
poverty and Tesla won't be the only one

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.080
that makes them. I think Tesla will

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.360
pioneer this but there will be many

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.040
other companies that make humanoid

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.000
robots. But there there is only

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.879
basically one way to uh make everyone

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.959
wealthy and that is AI and robotics.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.519
>> This scares a lot of folks here when it

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.280
comes to the future of jobs. So let's

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.760
hear about your thoughts uh Elon and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.319
Jensen on that.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.959
>> Uh sure. Well

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.560
um you say like in the long term where

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.360
will things end up? Long term I don't

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.360
know what long term is. Maybe it's

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.560
10 20 years something like that. For me

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.560
that's long term. Um my prediction is

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.200
that work will be optional.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.120
>> Optional.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.760
>> Optional.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.040
Um so

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.760
>> we'll take that.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.440
>> Yeah. I mean it it'll be like uh playing

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.799
sports or a video game or something like

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.040
that. Um if you want to work uh you know

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.760
in the same way like you can you can go

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.920
to the store and just buy some

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.920
vegetables or you could grow vegetables

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.120
in your backyard. It's much harder to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.799
grow vegetable vegetables in your

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.159
backyard, but some people still do it

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.879
because I like growing growing

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.080
vegetables. Um, that will be what work

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.440
is like, optional. Um, now between now

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.280
and then, there's actually a lot of work

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.159
to get to that point.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.120
>> Um, and I always recommend people read

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.879
read Yin Banks uh culture books to get a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.480
sense for what a probable

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.799
positive AI future is like. Um, and

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.480
interestingly in those books, money is

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.599
no longer doesn't exist. It's kind of

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.040
interesting. And I I my guess is in in

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.600
if you go out long enough, assuming

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.320
there's a continued improvement in AI

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.360
and robotics, which this seems likely,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.400
the money will will stop being relevant

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.280
at some point in the future. Um, now

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.880
there will still be constraints on power

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.880
like in it like electricity and mass. uh

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.720
the fundamental physics elements will

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.120
still be still be constraints. Um but um

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.240
I think at some point

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.800
uh currency becomes irrelevant.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.800
>> Jensen, any thoughts?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800
>> Um

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.000
by the way, the Nvidia earnings call is

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.360
later today.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.919
And by the way, since currency is

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.919
relevant.

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.919
>> Cheers.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.199
>> Elon just wants to share with you some

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.199
breaking news.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.080
The two of us who like to share some

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.320
breaking news. Uh let's see. I I would

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.160
say I would say there there's um

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.400
different horizons you could look at.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.960
Everybody's jobs will be different. that

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.840
I think that that's for sure. Uh how how

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.120
the students learn will be different. Um

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.120
how people do their work will be

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.600
different obviously because a lot of the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.400
things that that we do mundanely or

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.360
arduously or very difficultly are going

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.039
to be done very simply and and so we're

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.880
going to be more productive from that s

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.720
from that sense. One of the things that

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.880
I will say is that for most people or a

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.880
company, if some if your life becomes

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.280
more productive

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.919
and if the things that you're doing uh

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.080
with great difficulty become simpler, it

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.080
is very likely because you have so many

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.080
ideas, you'll have more time to go

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.560
pursue things. It is my guess that Elon

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.400
will be busier as a result of AI. I'm

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.000
going to be busier as a result of AI.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.240
And the reason for that is because we

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.919
have so many ideas we want to pursue, so

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.080
many things that that we still have in

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.160
our backlog inside our company that we

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.000
can go pursue. If we were more

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.720
productive, we can get to those things

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.720
faster. And so in the near term, I would

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.120
say that that there's every evidence

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.120
that that we will be more productive and

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.639
yet still be busier because we have so

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.880
many ideas. But we have some great

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.720
announcements to talk about here today.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.520
Let's begin with you, Elon. The things

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:46.080
that we're doing with XAI.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.919
So yeah, we we're we're doing a um XI

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.880
and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.199
doing a a

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.039
>> humane 500 megawatt starting with 50

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.520
megawatt phase one and we're doing it

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:57.919
with Nvidia. Congratulations to the

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.160
humane team to target team such a

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:03.599
fantastic job

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.720
>> as you know that AI is not just well

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:08.880
just agentic AI and chat bots and uh

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.960
cognitive AI is incredibly important to

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.880
the world. Uh but AI applies to

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.240
everything, chemicals and proteins and

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.919
genes and physics and fluid dynamics and

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.240
particles and of course robotics and

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:22.639
activation and um and we created this

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.759
world called Omniverse where robots can

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.599
learn how to be good robots and and it's

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.400
physically based. It obeys the laws of

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.759
physics and so robots can learn in these

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.880
environments and we're working with

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:37.440
Humane to apply Omniverse to all kinds

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.360
of uh digital factories and robotics and

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.520
warehouses and things like that. And so

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.840
that's that's another uh we're we're

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.080
also working uh in Saudi Arabia to build

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.280
supercomputers to simulate quantum

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.919
computers and and uh uh using our

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.680
computers to be the controller and the

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:55.759
error correction quantum error

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.759
correction requires an enormous amount

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:59.680
of computation and so so we're doing a

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:01.360
lot of great work there too. So a big

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.360
partnership with Humane they're off the

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.280
charts um off the ground and off the

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.599
charts at the same time. This is how we

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.080
walk the talk in the Kingdom of Saudi

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:12.560
Arabia in partnership with the US.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.479
Yesterday, the president and his Royal

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.199
Highness announced the AI strategic

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:20.160
framework and partnership. Today, we're

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:23.960
going big with Elon and Jensen. So,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.960
thank you for those opportunities.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.440
Now, they they told me I have time for

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.159
two last questions. So, last night at

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.000
the dinner, I got a number of questions

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.719
because it seems that the schedule

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.479
leaked and uh everybody was giving me

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:42.560
hints about the last two questions I'm

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:46.160
going to do. So, the first one was for

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.600
you, Elon, and there's a big one for

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:53.440
you, Jensen. So, prepare for that one.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:56.959
AI in space, is that possible?

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.120
>> Uh yes. If if civilization continues,

00:08:56.959 --> 00:09:01.120
which it probably will, uh then AI in

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.000
space is inevitable,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.480
um

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.360
um you know, I always have to like

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.360
preface that, you know, we shouldn't

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.920
take civilization for granted. We we

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.560
need to make sure to take care to ensure

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.480
that civilization has an upward arc. I

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.560
mean, any student of history knows that

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.480
civilization does not always have an

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.200
upward arc. And in fact, civilizations

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.279
have life life cycles. So hopefully we

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.120
are in a strong upward arc. I think we

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:31.120
are for now. Um but we don't want to

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.720
take that for granted or be complacent.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.440
Um but the in order to the way to think

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.440
of AI in space is that in order to

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.000
achieve any meaningful percentage of a

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.360
cartev 2 scale civilization where you're

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.560
using even a millionth a millionth of

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:51.600
the sun's energy, you must have solar

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:55.920
powered AI satellites in in deep space.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.440
Um so so that once you realize like once

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.920
you think in terms of a cottage two

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.320
scale civilization which is what what

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.200
percentage of the sun's energy are you

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.399
turning into useful work um then you

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.959
then it becomes obvious that space is

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:13.519
overwhelmingly what matters

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:16.640
overwhelmingly the sun only receives one

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:19.760
roughly 1/2 billionth of the earth only

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.519
receives roughly u two billionth of the

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.720
sun's energy

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:26.959
So if you want to have something that is

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.360
say a million times more energy than

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:35.120
Earth could possibly produce,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:37.040
>> you must go into space. It's and and so

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.600
um you know this is where it's kind of

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.680
handy to have a space company, I guess,

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.839
um sell the book.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.240
>> Easier to cool chips in space, too.

00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:46.160
>> Yes.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.360
>> Easier to cool chips in space. Yeah.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.480
>> Yes. There's definitely no water in

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.959
space, so you're going to have to do

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.800
something.

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:51.760
>> Yeah. Uh that doesn't involve water.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.360
>> Just hang out.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.000
>> Well, it's just got to radiate.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.120
>> That's right.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.279
>> Um

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.640
>> so

00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:04.160
my estimate is that actually that that

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:07.120
that the cost of of electricity like

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.320
like the cost effectiveness of AI in

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.079
space will be overwhelmingly better than

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.880
AI on the ground. So far long long

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:17.600
before you uh exhaust potential energy

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.800
sources on on Earth. Long long before

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.760
meaning like I think even perhaps in the

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.440
four or five year time frame the lowest

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:30.720
cost way to do AI compute will be with

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.920
solar powered AI satellites.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.920
So I'd say not more than 5 years from

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.800
now. Electricity generation is is

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.120
already becoming a challenge. Um so if

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.440
you if you start doing any kind of

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.720
scaling for both electricity generation

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:50.720
and cooling um you realize okay space is

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:53.440
incredibly compelling. Um so

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:58.079
like let's say you wanted to do um I

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.839
don't know two or 300 gawatt per year um

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:00.240
of of AI compute.

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:02.240
>> Yeah.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.440
>> Um it's very difficult to do that on

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.680
earth. Uh the so the the uh US average

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.200
electricity usage uh last time I checked

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:16.240
was around 460 gawatts per year average

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:18.399
usage. Um so so something like say uh

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.800
you know at 30 300 if you're doing 300

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:23.600
gawatt a year that would be like 2/3 of

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.800
US electricity production per year.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.560
>> There's no way you're building power

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.399
plants at that level.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.120
>> Um and then if you take it up to say a

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:33.360
terowatt per year impossible. Yeah. like

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.600
you have to do that in space. There

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:40.240
there just is there just is no way to do

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:42.959
a terowatt uh per year on Earth. Um

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:46.800
and uh and and in space you you've got

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:48.399
continuous solar. Um you've got uh you

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.760
don't you actually don't need batteries

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:50.720
because it's always sunny in space.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.680
>> That's right. Exactly.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.880
>> Um and um and and the solar panels

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.920
actually become cheaper because you

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.880
don't need glass or framing. Um and the

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.920
cooling is just radiative. So that's

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.200
that's why I think

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.680
>> that's the dream.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.720
>> Yes,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.880
>> that's the dream.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.120
>> So Jensen, everybody last night was

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.760
asking me and I'm mindful it's a

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.600
earnings uh call for you today. So I'm

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.000
going to say this delicately. Everybody

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.639
has been asking me to ask you, are we

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.560
going to have an AI bubble?

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:22.959
That's the last question. All right,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.399
let's No.

00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:26.880
All right, let me Well, let me just hear

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:28.560
you what we see. Okay. So, so I I think

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.240
it's really important when you look at

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.600
what's happening around the world and go

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.200
back to first principles of what's

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.040
happening in computer science and

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.360
computing. There are three things that

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.200
that's happening. The first thing is

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.279
that we all know that Moore's law has

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.120
run its course and the ability that the

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.639
amount of demand for computing versus

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.399
the amount of computation we can get out

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:48.240
of general purpose computing is really

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:50.079
challenging. And so the world's been

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.440
moving to accelerated computing for some

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:54.079
time. We've been pushing this now for

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.720
some over 20 years. Let me give you one

00:13:54.079 --> 00:14:00.320
statistic. I was just at supercomputing

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.680
six years ago. I

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.760
CPUs were 90% of the world's

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.320
supercomputers, top 500 supercomputers

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:13.440
six years ago. This year, less than 15%.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.880
Went from 90% to 10%. And meanwhile,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.320
accelerated computing went from the

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.399
other way, 10% to now 90%. Okay, so

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.720
you're seeing that inflection point, the

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.000
transition in high performance computing

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.920
from general purpose computing to

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.240
accelerated computing. Well, one of the

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.680
one of the most data inensive one of the

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.440
most intensive computation things that

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.519
the world does in cloud is data

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.160
processing. Several hundred billion

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:37.680
dollars of computation is done on just

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.360
raw data processing has nothing to do

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.279
with AI just SQL processing data frames

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.000
you know everybody's names address their

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:47.680
their sex their age where they live you

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.360
know how much money they make all of

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.959
that sits into a data frame and that

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.959
data frame drives the world today

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:54.880
whether it's in banking or you know

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:57.279
whether it's in credit cards or of

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.120
course e-commerce and uh everything from

00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:00.800
ad recommendation

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.320
everything is driven off of that data

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.240
frame that data frame cost hundreds

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.320
hundreds of dollars to go compute the

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.160
world is the internet is so gigantic

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.160
without a recommener system that a

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.440
little tiny phone of us will have no

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.720
chance of ever seeing the right

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.560
information that Rexus is the engine of

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.720
the internet today that's going

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.120
generative AI it used to be running on

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.240
CPUs now runs on GPUs which then says

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.480
the third thing when if you just look at

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.040
those two applications

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.680
many of the internet companies can build

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.240
enormous number of GPU supercomputers

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.399
Just doing that of course then it

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.399
creates this the third opportunity on

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:40.160
top of it which is agentic AI this is

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:42.160
grock and this is open AI this is

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.880
anthropic you know this is Gemini

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.880
agentic AI sits on top of that but don't

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.880
you know don't forget to think about

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.160
what is happening

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.720
above underneath what everybody sees as

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.399
AI today there's a whole movement of

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.639
computing from general purpose computing

00:15:56.399 --> 00:16:00.959
to accelerated computing and that if you

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:03.279
just if you take that into consideration

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:06.480
you'll come to the conclusion that in

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:09.680
fact what is left over to fuel that

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:12.000
revolutionary agentic AI is not only

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.920
substantially less than you thought and

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.519
all of it justified.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.680
>> Thank you for our lifetime partnership

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:18.480
and friendship. Thank you Elon. Thank

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.639
you Jensen.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.639
>> Thank you.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.720
All right.
