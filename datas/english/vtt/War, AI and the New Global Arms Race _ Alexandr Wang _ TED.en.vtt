00:00:04.626 --> 00:00:07.837
Artificial intelligence and warfare.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.340
Let's talk about
what this really could look like.

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:15.345
Swarms of lethal drones
with facial recognition

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:17.305
that know your every move.

00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:21.643
Or unmanned armed robots
that are near impossible to defeat.

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:25.772
Autonomous fighter jets
that can travel at supersonic speeds

00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:28.233
and can withstand
greater gravitational force

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.443
than a human pilot could survive.

00:00:30.443 --> 00:00:34.447
Cyberattacks that incapacitate
critical port infrastructure

00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:38.910
or disinformation campaigns and deepfakes
that throw presidential elections.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.664
Or even foreign adversaries
taking out satellites,

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:44.624
our eyes and ears in space,

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.085
rendering us blind to global events.

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:52.549
All superintelligent weapons of terror.

00:00:54.593 --> 00:00:57.596
We are at the dawn
of a new age of warfare.

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:00.974
I grew up in the birthplace
of a technology

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:03.351
that defined the last era of warfare,

00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:05.312
the atomic bomb.

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:10.400
I was keenly aware of how this technology
had fundamentally shaped geopolitics

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.277
and the nature of war.

00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:15.822
My parents were both scientists
at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:20.327
My dad’s a physicist,
and my mom’s an astrophysicist.

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:23.747
Their scientific work
in plasma fluid dynamics

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:27.375
will have deep implications
for how we understand our universe.

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:31.963
So naturally, I knew I wanted to work
on something just as impactful.

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:35.300
I decided to become a programmer
and study artificial intelligence.

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:40.597
AI is one of the most critical
technologies of our time

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:43.850
and with deep implications
for national security

00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:45.518
and democracy globally.

00:01:46.102 --> 00:01:49.230
As we saw in World War II
with the atomic bomb,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.525
the country that is able
to most rapidly and effectively

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:55.987
integrate new technology
into warfighting wins.

00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:59.491
There's no reason to believe
this will be any different with AI.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:04.663
But in the AI arms race,
we're already behind.

00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:06.873
From a technological perspective,

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:10.293
China is already ahead
of the United States

00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:11.961
in computer vision AI.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.714
And in large language models,
like ChatGPT,

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:16.257
they are fast followers.

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:19.386
In terms of military implementations,

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:21.262
they're outspending us:

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:23.431
adjusted for total military budget,

00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:26.601
China's spending ten times more
than the United States.

00:02:27.477 --> 00:02:28.895
Why are we so far behind?

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.399
The answer is twofold.

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.484
First, data supremacy.

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:39.781
Despite having the largest fleet
of military hardware in the world,

00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.369
most of the data from this fleet
is thrown away or inaccessible,

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.497
hidden away on hard drives
that never see the light of day.

00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:50.375
This is our Achilles heel.

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.505
In an AI war, everything
boils down to data.

00:02:57.215 --> 00:02:58.758
For defense AI,

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.803
data from the internet is not enough.

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:04.889
Most of the data needs to come
from our military assets,

00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:08.810
sensors and collaborations
with tech companies.

00:03:08.852 --> 00:03:12.981
Military commanders need to know
how to use data as a military asset.

00:03:13.773 --> 00:03:15.692
I've heard this first-hand many times,

00:03:15.692 --> 00:03:17.986
from my conversations
with military personnel,

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:19.863
including most recently

00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:22.240
from Lieutenant General
Richard R. Coffman,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.577
deputy commanding general
for United States Army Futures Command.

00:03:26.494 --> 00:03:30.290
Second, despite being home
to the leading technology companies

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:32.876
at the forefront
of artificial intelligence,

00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:35.503
the US tech industry
has largely shied away

00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:37.672
from taking on government contracts.

00:03:37.714 --> 00:03:39.466
Somewhere along the line,

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:43.762
tech leaders decided that working
with the government was taboo.

00:03:43.803 --> 00:03:45.054
As a technologist,

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:47.390
I'm often asked
how I'm bettering this world.

00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:51.352
This is how I'm improving
the future of our world:

00:03:51.394 --> 00:03:53.062
by helping my country succeed

00:03:53.062 --> 00:03:55.148
and providing the best tools
and technology

00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:58.693
to ensure that the United States
government can defend its citizens,

00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:00.153
allies and partners.

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:04.657
(Applause)

00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:09.913
The Ukraine war has demonstrated
that the nature of war has changed.

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:14.918
Through AI overmatch,
Ukraine is challenging an adversary

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.338
with far superior numbers
of troops and weapons.

00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:20.965
Before the Ukraine war,

00:04:21.007 --> 00:04:24.636
Russia had spent an estimated
65 billion US dollars

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:26.930
on its military expenditures,

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:29.933
whereas Ukraine only spent
about six billion dollars.

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:36.231
It's estimated that Russia
had over 900,000 military troops

00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:38.233
and 1,300 aircraft,

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:44.280
whereas Ukraine only had
200,000 military troops and 130 aircraft.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.616
Technologies such as drones,

00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:49.369
AI-based targeting and image intelligence

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:50.912
and Javelin missiles

00:04:50.912 --> 00:04:53.540
have enabled a shocking
defense of Ukraine.

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:59.462
AI is proving invaluable for defending
Ukrainian cities and infrastructure

00:04:59.504 --> 00:05:02.257
against missile and drone bombardment.

00:05:02.298 --> 00:05:05.969
At Scale, we’re using
our novel machine learning algorithm

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.848
for battle damage assessment
in key areas affected by the war.

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.935
We've rapidly analyzed
over 2,000 square kilometers

00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:17.564
and have identified
over 370,000 structures,

00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:19.941
including thousands
not previously identified

00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:22.026
by other open source data sets.

00:05:22.026 --> 00:05:25.989
We focused on Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:28.783
and provided our data directly

00:05:28.783 --> 00:05:32.203
in a publicly accessible data set
to the broader AI community.

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:34.455
One of the key problems we're solving

00:05:34.497 --> 00:05:39.419
is using AI to analyze massive amounts
of imagery and detect objects

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.963
because humans just can't keep up.

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.843
We've received an overwhelming response
from our free AI-ready data set

00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:50.722
and have provided it directly
to the United States and NATO allies.

00:05:50.763 --> 00:05:55.101
And it's been downloaded over 2,000 times
by AI companies, researchers,

00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:57.520
developers and GIS practitioners.

00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:00.982
AI can also be used for change detection.

00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:05.737
Simply put, algorithms
can constantly monitor imagery

00:06:05.737 --> 00:06:09.741
and notify a human to investigate further
if there's a change or a movement.

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:15.163
It's clear that AI
is increasingly powering warfare.

00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:19.125
And based on the rate of progress
in the AI field,

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:22.629
I predict that in ten years,
it will be the dominant force.

00:06:24.088 --> 00:06:28.176
Disinformation and misinformation
are already huge problems.

00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.388
And this technology
is only going to make it worse.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.184
Tools like ChatGPT
have enabled AI to generate imagery,

00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:40.480
text, audio, video, code and even reason.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.651
These tools can generate realistic-looking
and realistic-sounding content,

00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:47.153
which on top of bot-run
social media accounts

00:06:47.153 --> 00:06:50.114
will make it nearly impossible
to identify disinformation

00:06:50.114 --> 00:06:52.283
and misinformation online.

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:56.371
Bad actors can use these tools
to supercharge misinformation

00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:58.331
and propagate falsehoods.

00:06:58.373 --> 00:07:01.292
China already uses
disinformation campaigns

00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:04.128
and social media manipulations
heavily in Taiwan,

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.255
particularly during elections.

00:07:06.297 --> 00:07:08.049
Or take Russia's propaganda machine,

00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:11.135
which in the wake
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine

00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:13.888
created a deepfake
of Ukrainian President Zelensky

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.015
calling for Ukrainian troops to surrender.

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:18.768
This deepfake was easy to spot,

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.437
but the next one may not be.

00:07:21.437 --> 00:07:23.481
This also takes place within our borders,

00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:26.025
from social media algorithm manipulation

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:29.153
to advertising microtargeting
and geofencing,

00:07:29.153 --> 00:07:32.949
to deepfakes of politicians
and bot-run social media accounts.

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:34.575
The United States is not excused

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:37.245
from exacerbating
disinformation and misinformation.

00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:42.000
These tools are universally accessible
at low or no cost,

00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:44.293
meaning they can be employed
by anyone anywhere

00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:47.505
to undermine the sanctity
of democracy globally.

00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:51.217
However, all hope is not lost.

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:52.510
If we properly invest

00:07:52.552 --> 00:07:55.304
into data infrastructure
and data preparation,

00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:57.140
all this can be avoided.

00:07:57.181 --> 00:07:59.934
Deterrence is nothing new
to military thinking.

00:07:59.976 --> 00:08:02.895
As we saw in World War II
with the atomic bomb,

00:08:02.937 --> 00:08:06.274
it was a primary factor
in deterring foreign adversaries

00:08:06.274 --> 00:08:09.027
from going to nuclear war
for more than six decades.

00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:11.738
Because the stakes of going to war
with such a technology

00:08:11.738 --> 00:08:12.989
were simply too high.

00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:17.577
We're likely to see
a new calculus emerge with AI.

00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:20.747
It's uncharted territory,
nobody knows what it will look like

00:08:20.747 --> 00:08:22.665
or the toll it will take.

00:08:22.707 --> 00:08:25.710
How do we know if our AI
is better than our adversaries'?

00:08:25.752 --> 00:08:27.211
We won't.

00:08:27.253 --> 00:08:29.047
But one thing is clear:

00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:32.133
AI can only be as powerful
as the underlying data

00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:34.177
that is used to fuel its algorithms.

00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:39.891
Data will be a new kind of ammunition
in the era of AI warfare.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.520
In the tech industry,
we often talk about missions.

00:08:44.562 --> 00:08:46.314
They're often frivolous.

00:08:46.314 --> 00:08:49.776
Do they really change
the world or save lives?

00:08:49.776 --> 00:08:53.154
This mission, on the other hand,
really matters.

00:08:54.447 --> 00:08:56.991
The AI war will define
the future of our world

00:08:57.825 --> 00:09:00.870
and has the potential
to shift the balance of diplomatic power.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.832
It's clear that digital warfare

00:09:04.874 --> 00:09:08.294
is not some dystopian reality,
tucked away in a faraway future.

00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:11.089
It is taking place in the here and now.

00:09:12.673 --> 00:09:14.759
We cannot sit by the sidelines

00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:17.720
and watch the rise
of an authoritarian regime.

00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:19.055
It is in moments like this

00:09:19.097 --> 00:09:22.892
that technologists can either rise
to the challenge or stand idle.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.062
I encourage my fellow technologists

00:09:26.104 --> 00:09:28.815
to understand the austerity
and severity of our times

00:09:28.815 --> 00:09:32.026
and commit themselves
to supporting national security.

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:35.488
While I find it shocking
that most American AI companies

00:09:35.488 --> 00:09:37.990
have chosen not to support
national security,

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.450
I do hope others join us.

00:09:40.827 --> 00:09:43.621
We must fight for the world
we want to live in.

00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:45.832
It's never mattered more.

00:09:45.873 --> 00:09:47.125
Thank you.

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:51.003
(Applause)
