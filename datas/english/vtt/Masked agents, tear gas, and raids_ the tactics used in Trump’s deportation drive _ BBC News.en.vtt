00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.279
Extraordinary scenes have been playing

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.279
out in ordinary places across the United

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.160
States in recent months.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.160
>> Cheer gas in old Irvine Park.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.559
>> Wait, you guys came to the school and to

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
do this? Do

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.080
>> you have a word?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.080
>> What we're seeing is the result of a key

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.240
campaign promise from Donald Trump.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.840
>> On day one, I will launch the largest

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.840
deportation program in American history.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.080
Immigration and Customs Enforcement,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.560
otherwise known as ICE, is the main

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.200
agency implementing his plan to deport

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.520
millions of undocumented immigrants. But

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.879
other departments are also involved,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.040
including border patrol.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.800
>> These agents are usually stationed along

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.800
America's land borders, but they're

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.320
increasingly being seen making arrests

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.160
in US cities.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.440
>> This is a whole of government effort. We

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.360
have never seen anything like this in

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.680
the United States of America. This is an

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.600
unprecedented effort to reduce the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.680
immigrant population in the country.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.120
>> The Trump administration has reportedly

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.800
set ice a goal of 3,000 arrests a day.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.960
They're still some way off that. The

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.119
agency's average monthly arrests under

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.280
President Trump are about three times as

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.840
high as under President Biden over the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.760
same period last year. Trump says anyone

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.560
who has entered the country illegally is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.560
a potential target. Former ICE officials

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.720
like John Sanweg, who headed the agency

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.960
under Barack Obama, say previous

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.640
administrations prioritized arresting

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.320
those with a criminal record.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.799
>> It'd be a much more targeted surgical

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.200
strike. Not nearly as flashy, much lower

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.400
profile, and far less controversial. Of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.560
course, what we're see what was happened

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.840
here though is the administration didn't

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.280
like that approach. And the reason they

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.439
didn't like that approach is it doesn't

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.960
result in large numbers of arrests. What

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.040
this has resulted in is a shift in

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.439
tactics away from these more targeted

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.159
approaches, but just mass arrests of

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.479
people.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.640
>> BBC Verify has gathered more than 70

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.799
videos shared on social media of the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.759
current crackdown across several cities

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.880
since June, and we found free tactics

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.119
being widely used under Trump this term.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.439
Agents concealing their identities.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.799
>> What law enforcement agency?

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.880
>> People being arrested outside

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.360
immigration courts and other previously

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.360
protected places.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.160
and the use of weapons normally

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.040
associated with controlling riots like

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.120
tear gas on civilians. For your safety,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.360
>> the most widespread tactic we've seen is

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.760
officers hiding their faces. In more

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.440
than 80% of the videos we analyzed, some

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.319
of the officers involved are wearing

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.800
face coverings. In seven videos, some

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.519
agents are seen in plain clothing with

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.480
no clear law enforcement ID on display.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.160
They also often use unmarked vehicles.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.239
Immigration agents have operated

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.720
undercover in the past, but the

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.120
widespread use of face coverings is new.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.280
According to Deborah Fly Shaker, who was

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.319
the acting chief of staff at ICE under

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.280
President Biden,

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.319
>> masking is not something I've ever seen

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.680
done before. Um, these are people we

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.680
trust to carry guns on behalf of the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.519
federal government. By being masked and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.080
by failing to identify yourself, I think

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.239
that it is it is making the situation

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.959
more dangerous and putting people at

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.640
risk.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.400
>> The Trump administration says it's

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.959
necessary for the protection of the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.120
agents. They report officers and their

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.599
families are being threatened online and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.760
that they are facing a more than a,000%

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.920
increase in assaults. Although we can't

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.680
independently verify this figure,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.599
>> I'm going to answer the mask question.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.599
I'm sorry if people are offended by them

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.000
wearing masks, but I'm not going to let

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.360
my officers and agents go out there and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.440
put their lives on the line and their

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.120
family on the line because people don't

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.280
like what immigration enforcement is.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.440
The second tactical shift is where the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.799
arrests are taking place. Before Trump

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.959
entered office at the start of this

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.640
year, certain locations were typically

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.720
out of bounds for immigration

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.959
enforcement. But now we're seeing

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.159
federal agents in hospitals. Hey, hey,

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.360
hey, hey, hey.

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.360
>> And they patrol immigration courouses.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.400
When people are coming to court, it's

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.239
because they want to be following the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.799
process and trying to gain lawful status

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.599
in the United States. It's also because

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.560
if they don't come to court, they can be

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.080
ordered removed in their absence. So,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.400
it's a catch22.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.519
>> We verified several videos of arrests

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.840
taking place at 26 Federal Plaza in New

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.840
York. The immigration courthouse here

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.560
has become the epicenter of a crackdown

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.040
in the city. This incident there went

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.560
viral. A woman whose husband had just

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.560
been detained confronts an agent.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.360
[Laughter]

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.000
>> The officer was temporarily suspended as

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.400
a result. The third tactic we've

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.199
analyzed is the use of tear gas and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.040
other chemical irritants by officers. We

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.360
verified footage of them being used in

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.160
eight different incidents. This is a

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.840
raid in Los Angeles targeting suspected

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.080
illegal immigrants trying to pick up

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.800
construction jobs. One agent points

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.560
pepper spray at someone filming.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.560
Another deploys what appears to be a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.320
tear gas canister.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.400
>> Hands up for your safety. Hands up for

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.240
your safety. Tear gas has also been

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.320
deployed against civilians protesting

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.560
the crackdown, including in these

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.080
incidents which happened in Chicago in

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.759
October.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.919
Earlier in the month, a judge in the

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.479
city told agents to stop using such

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.800
weapons on protesters who pose no

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.520
immediate threat and has raised concerns

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.520
they still appear to be doing so. Dr.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.160
Rahini Ha has studied the dangers of

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.240
deploying tear gas in civilian settings.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.479
It's an indiscriminate weapon and so you

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.360
can't really target that towards an

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.199
individual that's posing a threat or is

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.600
causing harm. It will hit everybody in

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:49.280
the area. It appears that they're using

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.120
it excessively and unnecessarily and

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.800
quite disproportionately to what the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.800
threat is that's being posed.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.039
>> The Department of Homeland Security says

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.520
far-left protesters have interrupted

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.320
their work and a published video showing

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.560
people throwing objects towards agents.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.160
Congress basically handed ICE a blank

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.160
check. Anything they want to do now,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.400
they can afford to do. I think that what

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.000
we've seen largely up to this point has

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.759
been the opening act, and we're about to

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.479
get into the the meat of the

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.319
performance.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.039
>> Immigration raids and the protest

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:20.960
against them show no signs of slowing.

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.759
Recruitment drives to further bolster

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.800
ISIS ranks are well underway. That's

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.360
part of a $75 billion package approved

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.199
for the agency over the next four years.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.280
This will make it the highest funded law

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.280
enforcement body in the US by far.
