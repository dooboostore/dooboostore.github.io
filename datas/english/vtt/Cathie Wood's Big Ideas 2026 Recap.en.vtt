WEBVTT

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:08.639
Greetings everyone. It is time for ARCs

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.040
big ideas 2026 and I'm pretty excited

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.920
about it and I have to tell you right up

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.000
front I'm standing on the shoulders of

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.039
the research team and actually the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.080
marketing team and compliance and you

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:28.080
know really almost all the teams at ARC

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.880
uh especially Katie Keith and Walker who

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.160
spent eight hours to 16 hours a day in

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.880
the last few days to uh really make this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.280
the final push. So very happy to

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.399
introduce it to you again. Uh and so

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.360
I'll go very quickly uh through uh what

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.520
hit me uh as we have been going through

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.239
our research this past year and how we

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.000
crystallized it in big ideas. I'd like

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.399
to start with uh a section we're calling

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.719
the great acceleration.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.719
uh and what we're uh trying to

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:07.200
communicate is that AI is in early

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:10.799
stages still and that it has miles to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.920
go. Uh sure it feels like it's a hype

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.240
cycle because capital spending in the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.720
tech and telecom uh sectors as a percent

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.680
of GDP is nearly as high now as it was

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.920
during the tech and telecom bubble. Uh

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.439
but if you will remember the tech and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.119
telecom bubble laid fiber and most of it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:40.159
remained dark. Uh today

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:43.520
uh the GPUs are driving this cycle and

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.640
uh and I'll steal from uh Brad Gersonner

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.439
at Altimter. He's saying those aren't

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.079
dark. They're in short supply and they

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.360
are being used. Uh and we agree

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.159
completely with that. uh we compare this

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.560
capital spending cycle uh to the

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:08.399
railroads in the 1800s that got up to

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:11.599
five to six% of GDP and then uh the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.680
automobile uh explosion

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:19.840
in the early 1900s that got up to 3 to

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.280
4% of GDP and then we get to the tech

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.520
and telecom bubble that when you added

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.480
software and hardware comm equipment

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.560
together. That was about the same size

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.640
as the auto capital spending cycle. And

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:42.640
uh we're about there now with in this

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.200
cycle with AI, robotics, energy storage,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.680
uh multiomic sequencing, blockchain

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.800
technology. But we think we're going a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.680
lot higher. we think we will go up to

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.800
our capital spending as a percent of GDP

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.360
will rise to 12%.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.640
Uh and I'll get into some of the reasons

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.519
why but key is productivity as usual

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.879
economics productivity.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.159
Uh so uh we've we believe we're fairly

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.000
early in this cycle. So let me uh before

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.440
I go on to some of the productivity

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.040
gains that we see uh also highlight that

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.319
as a result of this investment boom

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.360
uh and the increased productivity that

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:31.680
we see we believe that real GDP growth

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.760
will accelerate towards the 7% plus

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.040
range uh by 2030.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.319
uh the ingredients are all there and it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.720
is also a hallmark of technology

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:50.159
revolutions that we see a step function

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:55.519
change in GDP. Uh the 400 years until

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:57.920
1900 for example uh global GDP averaged

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.319
0.6%.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.799
And then in the late 1800s, early 1900s,

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.120
of course, we had the railroads, uh we

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.519
had telephone, electricity, the internal

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.159
combustion engine, a technology

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:19.280
revolution. Uh that 0.6% real GDP growth

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:22.160
went to 3% for the last 125 years. Uh

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.520
and so that was a fivefold step up in

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.880
GDP growth. We're saying maybe a two and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.600
a half uhfold step up, but I actually

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.320
think that's conservative uh given the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.600
five innovation platforms evolving at

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.840
the same time. Robotics, energy storage,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.040
artificial intelligence,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.479
uh multiomic sequencing, and blockchain

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.199
technology. Uh and those innovation

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.840
platforms are converging.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.639
uh and that's what's causing the great

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.479
acceleration here. So I'll take you

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:01.680
through uh a few of the stats and and

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.400
the aha moments we've had this year uh

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.280
as we were doing our research. So Frank

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:12.479
and Joseph on the uh AI infrastructure

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:17.199
side. Uh so we believe that the data

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:22.080
center uh in uh infrastructure cycle

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:25.919
which uh is at about 500 billion now up

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.199
from up two and a half times from prej

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:33.520
chat GBT that that is actually going to

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:37.039
1.4 trillion dollars per year uh by

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.600
2030. Thank goodness we had the chat GBT

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.479
moment because that was the aha moment

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.479
for all of us uh as we're saying wait a

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.479
minute look what I can do with this this

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:50.080
is a miracle and now we see as we've

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:55.759
done the analysis and you'll find this

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:59.440
in uh in big ideas that that $20

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:02.479
subscription that each of us pays here

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:07.360
at ARC uh well actually Arc pays for it

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:11.520
but the $20 per seat um subscription and

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.400
in uh a few cases the $200

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.800
uh per month subscription uh for those

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:22.639
heavy users uh the $20 we're paying off

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:26.479
in about a half days uh work. So the

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.960
payoff time is almost nothing uh as we

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.680
are able to do our research and leverage

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.880
our time enormously.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.199
Uh we also think and this is this is

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.160
somewhat controversial because software

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:44.080
stocks have been going through a very

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.960
difficult time ironically through this

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.560
AI boom and it is because of the

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.560
disruption that AI is going to cause uh

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:58.400
to the in particular SAS uh but all

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:02.800
legacy software. uh we think that uh

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:09.199
software will grow the market will grow

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:13.280
at roughly 19% in our bare case to uh I

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:17.280
think it's 54% per year in our bull case

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:20.880
uh up from 14% per year over the last 5

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.800
to 10 years. Uh but you have to get on

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.199
the right side of change. A lot of those

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.599
software companies are in the private

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:31.280
markets, uh, OpenAI, Anthropic,

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:33.120
XAI,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.919
uh, and

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.479
and in the public markets. The real

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:43.039
success story of course has been in the

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:45.039
platform as a service part of the tech

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.400
stack and that of course the poster

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:50.240
child there is Palunteer. So again, have

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.639
to get on the right side of change. I'm

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.879
not saying that all the SAS providers

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.440
are going to be crushed. It's going to

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:59.840
be like all legacy players. You'll

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.879
probably have, you know, the market

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.599
consolidate and there'll be one very big

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:07.120
player. You know, Walmart in retail, for

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:10.479
example,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.080
uh is is um is how we're thinking about

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:16.080
this. or as we get into fintech and

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.800
blockchain technology and DeFi

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.840
disrupting the traditional financial

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.840
world, JP Morgan's probably going to be

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.720
fine. It is harnessing these

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:30.160
technologies and it probably will

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.880
consolidate the market. Um, I'd like to

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.120
flip back to the consumer side. So, I've

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.800
just given you more the enterprise side

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:41.760
on the consumer side. So uh Nick and

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.560
Vika have done this work and I think

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.880
they might have been two years ago the

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.920
first ones to even think about this

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:54.959
concept of an AI purchasing agent or now

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.640
we're calling them AI assistants

00:08:54.959 --> 00:09:00.880
uh or and and other such things uh but

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.160
based on that work and you can see it in

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:09.519
big ideas they believe that the

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:12.160
advertising market is going to go uh to

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:16.720
65%

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:22.560
uh in this AI space AI generated space

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:26.320
uh and that shopping commerce will be I

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:30.720
I think that that it will be 25% of it

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:33.519
will be powered by the AI space. Uh so

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.760
stay tuned to uh or definitely take a

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:39.440
good look at their blogs and uh their

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:42.800
big ideas chart. Uh David in uh the

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.600
Bitcoin realm uh it's been controversial

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:50.000
this year because uh we had the draw

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:53.360
down after the flash crash 1010 uh in

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.399
October. Uh we think that a lot of the

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:59.680
deleveraging associated with really that

00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:02.560
was a software glitch I think at Binance

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.240
uh that that deleveraging automated

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.480
deleveraging

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.480
um caused 28 billion dollars of carnage.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.880
uh we think we've worked through that

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:19.760
now and I think the main question on uh

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:23.120
Bitcoiners minds is okay are we

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.640
finished with the traditional four-year

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.839
downdraft every four years a downdraft

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.560
in uh the cycle uh we're beginning to

00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:35.279
think we are uh although we could base

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.839
here in the 80 to9,000

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:41.440
range for a while but we do believe the

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:44.959
next inflection is up. And while I know

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:47.600
I got we got a lot of publicity this

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:50.720
year because we talked about stable

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:54.000
coins usurping uh one of the roles we

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.720
expected Bitcoin to play. Uh now we

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.320
expected this 10 years ago before stable

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:03.760
coins happened on the scene. Um but uh

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:07.760
in terms of remittances uh and emerging

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.320
market uh activity, we're seeing stable

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:14.320
coins usurp that role that we thought uh

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:16.480
Bitcoin uh would would provide. Uh that

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.959
doesn't take away though from what we

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.079
think ultimately will happen to Bitcoin.

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:24.320
Bitcoin's role as digital go gold has

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:27.120
miles to go. Interestingly, and you'll

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.320
see this in my New Year letter, the

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.959
correlation between Bitcoin and gold has

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.800
been almost non-existent over Bitcoin's

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:38.959
life.14.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:42.640
Um, nonetheless, we do think it is not

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:44.320
only a riskon asset thanks to the new

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.000
technology,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:51.040
uh, but it is also a riskoff asset. It's

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.040
a hedge against inflation. Uh, its

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:59.040
growth rate is lower than gold's growth

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:01.600
rate. And I'll bet gold miners are doing

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.200
their darnest to get more of that stuff

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.440
out of the ground now that they're being

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.720
paid so much more. That can't happen

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.839
with Bitcoin. Uh, and Bitcoin miners

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:16.240
mathematically metered to top out at 21

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:19.279
million units. Uh so uh we do think it

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:23.040
will be a very important store of value

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:25.920
going forward uh particularly as we go

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.800
through the intergenerational wealth

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:33.760
wealth transfer that we expect during

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:38.399
the next um during the next 5 10 15

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:42.560
years. Um, we also uh had a lot more on

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:44.880
DeFi and tokenized assets. Uh, stable

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.720
coins, just a little bit more uh on

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:53.200
that. I think we passed $300 billion

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:56.880
globally in stable coins. We saw a a

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.399
very large increase in the in

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.560
tokenization

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:05.600
on on public blockchains up to uh 19

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.519
billion. Now that's a large increase. I

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.399
think that was a tripling or maybe even

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:13.519
more in the last year. But we ultimately

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:16.880
think that's going to 11 trillion uh

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:19.920
highlighted by public equities,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.639
sovereign debt and bank deposits. So

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.839
it's going to be a very big market and

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:29.600
we are putting out a DeFi quarterly now

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:33.440
uh to uh accompany our Bitcoin

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.560
quarterly. Uh so stay tuned pay a lot of

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.800
attention there uh because there's a a

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.279
lot of excitement brewing and there will

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.320
be a lot of dislocations

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:47.920
uh in the financial sector uh because of

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.519
this wholesale shift uh really to a new

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.320
technology

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:56.160
uh and so we're pretty excited about

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:59.040
that. Um the other thing we'd like to

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.680
highlight is you know these these

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.519
companies their their productivity the

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.639
companies that are emerging their

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:10.399
productivity is astonishing. Uh Tether

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:16.000
for example last year uh we believed uh

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:18.240
I believe uh delivered uh $50 million

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.240
per employee.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:26.880
Um that is unheard of unheard of. Uh but

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:29.120
we think the the capitalizing uh on all

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.000
of these new technologies is going to

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.560
drive productivity gains much higher

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
than people can even postulate right

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.959
now. And with that while many people are

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.600
afraid given the robotics movement of

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:46.160
you know and AI everyone being thrown

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.160
out of jobs we disagree. Uh we think

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.360
this is going to be one of the greatest

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:55.279
opportunities for the entrepreneurial

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:58.880
spirit in history. Uh especially because

00:14:55.279 --> 00:15:01.920
you can go to chat GBT or Grock and and

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:04.959
say you know I think there's a huge

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.560
unmet need for this that or the other

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:10.800
product or service. Think about it. And

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.040
I would like to start that business.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.880
Boy, when we started Arc there, I would

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:20.959
have loved to have a starting point like

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:24.720
that. And you can work with uh ChatgBT

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:27.199
uh XAI, Grock, uh to build your

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.079
business. Uh try it. If you're looking

00:15:27.199 --> 00:15:32.639
for a job, uh figure out what's that

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:34.880
unmet need. Uh I'm going to try and

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:37.199
start that business. And uh believe me,

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.399
starting a business very exciting,

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:43.760
exhilarating actually uh but full of

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:46.959
risk. Remember, 90% of all startups

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:49.519
fail. So just go in soberly that way.

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:52.959
Make sure you're addressing a real unmet

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:55.040
need. And then harness AI, harness

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:58.160
blockchain technology, harness any of

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.120
these new technologies. Now when we get

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:05.120
to multiomics normally I start glazing

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:08.480
over but uh I think multiomics which is

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:12.399
life sciences and really the convergence

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.880
among sequencing technologies

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:18.639
uh artificial intelligence

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.279
and new technologies like crisper gene

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:25.279
editing. What are we doing? We're

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:28.240
diagnosing cancer in stage one or before

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:30.079
stage one. Polyps also shed into the

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.680
blood. And this is just with blood

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:36.639
tests. We're collapsing the cost of drug

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:40.959
discovery and development. We think it

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:45.199
could drop from 2.4 billion for one drug

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:47.279
uh to roughly 700 million over the next

00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:50.480
four years. And that of course includes

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:53.680
the failures along the way. Uh and then

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:57.279
most provocatively and and Sheay uh has

00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:00.399
done an amazing job of documenting

00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:02.880
uh what a cure is going to be worth and

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:05.679
I have to give Brett Winton uh

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:09.839
incredible credit as he partnered with

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:13.199
Sheay uh on this project to uh try and

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:16.640
figure out how much is a cure worth. Uh

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:20.000
and we think while the cure for HE,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:22.079
which is a very rare disease, uh would

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.959
be worth

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:28.559
$11 million.

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:32.240
One and done. You get this treatment and

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:35.280
you're done. Uh that's Intellia's um

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.400
trial right now and it's in vivo. You

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.360
don't have to go through any

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:43.200
excruciating preconditioning.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.720
um it could be worth 11 million. That's

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.960
how much it would save the system. Uh

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.880
but they'll probably be able to charge

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.960
three million. And believe me, insurance

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.520
companies, they will have no problem

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.840
with that. Uh so take a look at that

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.919
section. It's it's fascinating. It's the

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:04.559
best one we've ever done. And then we

00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:08.640
get into reusable rockets. Uh and it is

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:12.400
astonishing. SpaceX 10 years ahead.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:17.760
of any competitor. It landed its first

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:21.200
reusable rocket in 2015 and now it owns

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.840
twothirds of the satellite market and

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:30.640
something like 85%

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:34.320
of all of the upmass uh put into orbit.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:37.200
Uh and of course now uh we've discovered

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:41.520
a new use case and it couldn't happen

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:46.000
without reusable rockets

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:49.600
uh data centers in space and this is a

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.679
fairly new introduction to you know our

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.320
line of thinking and of course inspired

00:18:51.679 --> 00:19:00.480
by Elon himself. Uh so take a look at uh

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:03.440
at our reusable rocket uh section and be

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.520
inspired by that whole new world that's

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.679
being developed. Many people when

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.880
they're talking about automation and AI

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:13.520
and unemployment. Uh one of the things I

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:17.360
say is wait a minute there are two new

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:19.679
worlds evolving here. Uh outer space a

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.480
completely new world. All kinds of jobs

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:26.960
are going to be associated with that. Uh

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:32.080
and then in the digital realm now thanks

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:35.360
to blockchain technology we are seeing

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:39.679
immutable property rights in the digital

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:43.280
realm for the first time. The the best

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:47.840
way to lift people and countries out of

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:50.799
poverty is with immutable

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.520
private property rights.

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:56.880
and that's what we have and it's just

00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.160
starting. Uh so we're pretty excited

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.280
about that. Um and then we've got

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:07.679
distributed energy. We've done a lot

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:11.600
with nuclear uh power this past year. Uh

00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:16.080
Daniel and Sam uh Chorus who've also

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:20.080
done our uh reusable rocket work. Um

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:23.679
it's excellent research. uh they uh have

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:28.640
done our work on nuclear power as well

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:32.320
and uh it is shocking uh to see how

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:34.559
regulation stunted the growth of nuclear

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.159
in the mid70s.

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:40.000
If

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:44.000
regulation had not stopped the cost

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.240
declines for developing nuclear plants

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.520
from continuing,

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:55.919
uh, electricity costs today would be 40%

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:59.360
lower than they are now. Uh so we have

00:20:55.919 --> 00:21:03.679
high hopes that nuclear power is going

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:07.280
to help us uh once again uh as they

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:11.679
scale drive down the cost of electricity

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:15.679
and be a counterforce to the demands

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:19.520
that AI and data centers are are placing

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:23.039
on our grid right now. Uh so take a look

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:27.200
at that work. Uh and then of course of

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:30.240
course Tasha Keiny and Daniel again on

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:33.600
um other autonomous vehicles. So we've

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:37.120
got robots and rockets uh other

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:41.120
autonomous vehicles of course robo taxis

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:45.760
and we believe that we are in uh the

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:47.280
midst of the birthing of the robo taxi

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.960
market.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:55.120
uh and uh you've seen our work there. Um

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:59.679
we've updated it uh uh to show that

00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:03.360
Tesla's competitive edge over Whimo is

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:05.919
uh is has well at least according to our

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.080
estimates increased. We used to think

00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:11.120
that their cost structure Tesla's cost

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:14.320
structure would be 35% lower than

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.400
Whimo's. uh but as we have refined our

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:20.559
analysis, we now believe it's going to

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:25.039
be 50% lower. And it is very interesting

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:28.720
uh to watch Uber and others uh trying to

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:31.120
insinuate themselves into this space.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.000
They know it's important, but we have

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:38.400
been saying all along and still believe

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:43.120
that Uber and others will be lead

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:45.600
generators for Tesla and Whimo, which

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.960
will probably be number two as they

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.840
scale throughout the US. And one of the

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:54.640
most interesting piece of pieces of work

00:22:51.840 --> 00:23:00.400
uh that Tasha and Daniel did this year

00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:03.679
was on uh the percent of urban miles uh

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:07.280
that Uber covers uh right now in the

00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:10.640
United States. It's about 1%. And so we

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.240
did a calculation. How many autonomous

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.159
vehicles

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:20.480
uh would Tesla have to produce or Whimo

00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:26.720
uh to cover 1% of urban miles? Uh that

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:29.200
would be 140,000 units. Now what uh what

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.960
would be the number? How many vehicles

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:35.760
would it take to cover

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:40.720
all urban miles?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:45.039
And that number is only 24

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:49.840
million. That is less than 10%

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:53.919
of the installed base of v of autos uh

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:56.080
in the US today. So that is a US uh that

00:23:53.919 --> 00:24:01.760
is US analysis.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:05.520
And uh we know that auto sales right now

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:09.440
they're at roughly 15 million uh per

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:12.400
year. That gives you a sense of how much

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.000
the auto market in terms of vehicles

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:19.200
produced could shrink and yet we could

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.559
still cover with autonomous vehicles

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:25.520
which obviously have much higher

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:28.880
utilization than personal vehicles. We

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:32.159
drive our cars four to 5% of the day

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.440
whereas an autonomous vehicle could be

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:38.720
50 60% of the day. Uh so you get the

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.840
sense of how much the vehicle market

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.520
could shrink and still we'd be able to

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.440
satisfy

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:50.960
100% of all the urban miles in uh the

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:54.880
United States today. uh and we do think

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:59.360
that uh and we still think that the

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:03.600
autonomous vehicle market will drive 30

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:08.240
I think it's 35 billion 34 trillion

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:15.520
sorry billions trillions um 34 trillion

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:18.799
dollar in market cap uh by 2030 in 2030

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:22.240
trillion for the global ecosystem

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:24.159
system, not only the auto providers and

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.120
the lead generators, but most

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:29.600
importantly the platform providers and

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:33.200
they will get the lion share of the

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:36.000
economics as Tasha and uh Daniel show

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.600
you and then finally autonomous

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.320
logistics

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:44.720
um autonomous trucks will cut delivery

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:49.600
costs by 60%.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:51.120
Uh, drones and rolling robots are also

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:54.000
going to cut delivery costs

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:59.279
dramatically. Did you know there are

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.919
already 4 million deliveries per year by

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:05.440
drones? Uh, now to be sure, Zipline, uh,

00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:08.799
one of the companies in our venture

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:14.960
fund, uh, is responsible for, I think,

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:20.400
half of those. Um but uh we believe that

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:24.320
the cost to deliver by drone uh will cut

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:28.720
delivery costs. Right now Door Dash $15

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:31.440
per uh to less than a dollar. So a 90%

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:35.600
reduction over time. So this is a hu

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:39.760
another huge market uh percolating out

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:43.919
there. And um we're so excited because

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:47.360
we believe we're now in the prime time

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:51.679
for the reason I founded ARK. I founded

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:55.279
ARC in 2014 for this reason. I felt that

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:57.679
ARC's research would fulfill an unmet

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:59.840
need. And I'm very proud of the research

00:26:57.679 --> 00:27:02.559
we're doing. It's the kind of research

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.320
that investment banks used to do when

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:08.320
the M&A market uh was much more vibrant

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:11.919
than it has been for the last four

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:15.760
years. Uh in the under the last FTC, it

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:18.960
was shut down. So, our research has met

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:22.640
uh or fulfilled an unmet need. And we're

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:26.240
so happy to see our research in the

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:29.039
startup decks of so many startups out

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:31.679
there. Um because what are startups

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:34.240
doing? They're heads down trying to

00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:36.880
innovate as fast as they can. And what

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.080
are we doing? We're helping to size the

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:42.720
markets they're going after. I think

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:46.720
that the wall of worry that we have been

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:48.240
facing in the last few years around

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.120
innovation

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.159
is great. I think it's great because of

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:57.520
course there are risks associated with

00:27:54.159 --> 00:28:00.640
innovation. Uh but we think that the

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:04.960
flywheel now is in place so that this

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:08.480
innovation age is unstoppable.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:12.679
And uh we'd welcome you to read our big

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.679
ideas 2026.
