00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.990
- Hi, Vogue.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.310
I'm Sora.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.610
I'm gonna show you my skincare routine.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.550
I'm literally, literally shy person.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.183
First step, wash my face.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.492
This is my favorite cleanser.

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:18.060
[light music]

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.260
This smell is so good.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.583
So literally, I love it.

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:24.720
[light music]

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.550
My skin is...

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.133
Thank you, Mom and Dad. My skin is strong.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.500
This is Essence from Korea.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
This is very moisturizing, hydrated,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.100
and very, you know, gentle.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.340
So probably baby, they can use.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.730
This is cream for the same brand.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.690
The Essence.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.834
Very light, hydrated.

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.743
[light music]

00:00:52.743 --> 00:00:56.640
When I started the modeling, 18 years old,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.940
they do very heavy makeup.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.580
My skin is not too sensitive skin,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.620
and then very strong,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.290
so not make trouble.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.433
But now getting older a little bit,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.455
so getting trouble a little bit sometime.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:17.220
I get 30 years old,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
I started to care for the skin.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.720
This is for that spot care.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.720
When I get the spot, the acne,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.013
I just do top coat like this.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.120
And then after the day, it's come down.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.460
So my favorite one too.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.740
My friend recommended to me

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.240
when I wake up in the morning,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.770
puffy.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.840
So this one is making puffy down.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.776
If you get really puffy
person, use that stuff.

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:56.673
[light music]

00:01:56.673 --> 00:01:57.735
Just one minute.

00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:00.300
[light music]

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.220
This is hair brush.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.940
But also, I can do the Gua Sha too.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.940
So I do like here.

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:12.540
[light music]

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.810
This spot, doing the Gua Sha,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.093
making lifting like this, so.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.970
It work.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.620
I'm very lazy person.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.420
If I'm not doing the modeling,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.240
I'm not really do the skin care,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.583
and I'm not really doing the Gua Sha too.

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:33.270
[light music]

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.970
Oh, it feels like fresh.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.400
So this is sun cream.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.140
I'm not really use foundation normally

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.010
because I hate it.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.180
Heavy feeling.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.332
This is very light, very natural toner.

00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:51.832
[light music]

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.780
See? Tiny bit.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.850
Tiny bit natural toner.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.140
I use the Chanel cheek.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.613
The two color I have.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.520
This is more like a natural color,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520
and this is more like a [speaks Korean].

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.980
Today, natural.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.720
I was really quiet and really shy person.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.360
So it was school,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.547
and my friend come to me,

00:03:21.547 --> 00:03:24.180
"Sora, I wanna do the model,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.250
but I don't wanna go alone,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.920
so can you come with me?"

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.250
Normally, I say no. Why?

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.423
Why I have to go?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.070
But I just, I don't know why, I say yes.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.720
They really interesting to me.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.517
And then I just came out my brain.

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:45.720
"Oh, interesting. Why not?"

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.280
I was really not confident person,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.120
so I didn't know top model.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.470
I didn't know that.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.710
Now I love the shooting,

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.110
but I prefer the runway

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.240
because more, like, exciting.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.300
My life, I wanna be mom.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.800
I wanna get five baby.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.583
Girl, girl, boy, boy, girl.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.790
Someone say, "Get first

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.950
and you will be changing the mind."

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.560
So then think.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.773
My next makeup step is powder.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.143
This is very light and
tiny with popular color.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.880
So they make little bit tone up too.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.240
I'm not really, don't like the sticky.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.250
My favorite runway show.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.680
My first show, Louis Vuitton Cruise Show

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.860
10 years ago.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.050
Actually, I was in Korea,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.737
and then my Korean booker call me.

00:04:48.737 --> 00:04:50.880
"Hey, Sora, we talking

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.420
about outside Korea, doing the modeling.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.600
So, you interesting? So, yes?"

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.370
And then she say, "So,
you have to go Paris

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.687
four days after, so."

00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:05.520
"What?"

00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.960
[Sora speaking Korean]

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.580
It was so fast.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.920
After four days, I had to go Paris.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.540
And then landing up there

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.580
and then straight to go to casting.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.490
I just packing my high heel,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.657
my [indistinct].

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.540
Okay.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.510
The casting director, she called me back.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.420
And that changed the look.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.200
And then I working, have five time.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.230
And then they call someone.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.843
So she come to me.

00:05:38.843 --> 00:05:43.770
"Sora, can you walk more
like a tough, strong eye,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.710
strong working, powerful,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.390
like, confident something?"

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.400
So, "Oh, okay."

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.840
So I walking.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.367
And then the Nicholas, he say,

00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:57.697
"Oh my God, this is perfect.

00:05:57.697 --> 00:06:00.210
That look is for you. Only for you."

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.510
So I did the show in Morocco.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.980
Wow.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.456
My next step, makeup fixer.

00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:11.610
[light music]

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.190
This is very light. So I love it.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.400
This is the lip balm.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.603
Change the color too.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.606
And very light.

00:06:20.606 --> 00:06:23.106
[light music]

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.660
Sometime when I go out, I'm not really

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.530
bring to this one, I use the this one.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.163
So I just do the like this.

00:06:33.163 --> 00:06:35.663
[light music]

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.703
Easy.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.620
And the color is really nice too.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.790
Natural.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.930
This is my favorite hand cream.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.280
JINsoon.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.483
She's Korean too.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.760
So nice person.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.910
And sometimes I wanna be more drama.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.663
I do the mascara.

00:06:55.663 --> 00:06:58.050
[light music]

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.453
Doing like a tiny bit.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.963
Tiny bit. Tiny bit like that.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.530
Because I'm not really use the eyeliner.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.664
So doing the mascara

00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:14.580
a tiny bit more like a [speaks Korean].

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.595
This is my favorite body cream too.

00:07:18.595 --> 00:07:21.180
[light music]

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.880
Really fun backstage memory.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.356
It was four years ago, something.

00:07:26.356 --> 00:07:31.320
After the show, I rushed to go next show.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.750
I just have one hour between.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.313
But all the guests sitting in the runway.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.940
So I just doing like, "I'm sorry.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.140
I'm a model.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.390
I'm so sorry. I need to go."

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.630
And I'm go inside. Everyone waiting to me.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.710
And I first just changing the look.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.620
And it doing one person, one person,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.060
one person, one person,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.500
one person, one person.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.210
One person, the feet.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.100
One person, the other feet.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.440
I just standing like this position

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.397
and the production team come to me,

00:08:06.397 --> 00:08:07.800
"Hey, Sora, you working

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.960
like this, this, this, this, this, this.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.407
You understand?"

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.647
"Okay, I will be my best."

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.910
And then just 10 minutes
after, just start.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.743
So [whistles].

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.090
But I'm not missing, so everything good.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.870
This is my favorite, favorite perfume.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.730
But discontinued.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.247
When I wear this perfume,
people come to me.

00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:34.590
"What's your perfume?"

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.540
It's a very good combination,

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.740
my skin smell and this.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.950
And then when I go to the fitting

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.460
or, like, a studio or, like, a backstage,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.820
everyone know my smell

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.020
because I only use this one.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.973
I just searching eBay.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.830
So I buy everything.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.560
So I have a 20 piece, this one.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.770
But I was doing this perfume light,

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.230
almost like a perfume shower like that.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.577
But now [speaks Korean].

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.793
So I do like, boop.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.790
That's it.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.993
I almost forgot.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.420
This is my favorite red lip color.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.923
Sexy, pretty, chic, everything.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.070

Thank you for watching my beauty secret.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.503
I'm ready to go.
