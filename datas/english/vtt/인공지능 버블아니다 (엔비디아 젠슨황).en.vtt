00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.000
This is for certain. Everybody's jobs

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.680
will change as a result of AI. Some jobs

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.279
will disappear. Obviously, every single

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.960
industrial revolution, some jobs are

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.480
just gone and but a whole bunch of new

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.000
jobs are created. Everybody will have to

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.040
use AI because if you don't use AI,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.759
you're going to lose your job to

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.640
somebody who does.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.080
>> Google CEO Sundar Pachai said this week

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.400
>> uh that there were elements of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.920
irrationality in the stock market around

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.760
AI right now. Do you agree with him?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.279
>> There's always some irrationality

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.680
somewhere in the stock market. I think

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.359
that that's a fair thing to say. Um I

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.840
would say though the part that most

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.360
people miss is that underneath the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.960
foundation of chatbots and agentic AI is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.239
a transformation of computing from

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.200
general purpose to accelerated

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.320
computing. When do you then then gauge

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.399
um uh the the investments incremental on

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.680
top of that relative to the opportunity

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.120
of generative a or agentic AI AGI on top

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.879
of that then you'll come to the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.800
conclusion in fact it's very modest.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.120
It's still significant, but it's modest

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.920
in in relative to the overall computing

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.079
market.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.359
>> So, you're uh somewhere between four and

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.640
five trillion dollar company right now.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.559
A lot of that cash flow that you're

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.500
bringing in as revenue. Uh you're

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.560
investing in other companies

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.880
[clears throat] in the space. Some

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.880
people in the the world of analysts and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.799
the stock market are saying this creates

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.640
a degree of circularity. Uh there's

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.119
vendor financing here. It could create

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.479
extra systemic risk. Uh if for example,

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.159
companies like OpenAI, which is not

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.920
profitable, fails to meet uh the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.600
commitments that it's making to buy data

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.920
centers. mostly full of your chips. Are

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.159
you concerned that there is a growing

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.560
structural risk related to all of those

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.920
things?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.200
>> Not because of this reason.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.200
>> Um for any other reason.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.799
>> Well, if there are other reasons that we

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.479
can talk about, but not for this, you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.079
know, not for this particular reason.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.240
Let me tell you why. Every single

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.079
transaction we do, every single purchase

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.320
order that we take, we still go back to

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.680
first principles and we ask ourselves,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.720
do you really have the demand for it?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.240
Because if you don't have the demand for

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.920
it, somebody else has demand for it. The

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.320
reason why we invest is several reasons.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.079
One is to expand our ecosystem. If you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.560
look at the investments that that we

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.320
will likely make and have made up to now

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.159
and you compare it to the revenues that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.640
we have that we're generating, it's in

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.240
the single low single digits. And so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.320
that kind of tells you how could low

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.080
single digits create circularity. And

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.080
then very importantly, this is the last

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.760
reason. These are consequential

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.599
companies, most important companies of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.000
our time. And we have the opportunity to

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.080
be have a front seat, front row seat

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.920
partnership with them. we kind of also

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.840
have, if you will, inside information

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.920
about how successful they're doing and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.200
so the opportunity to invest in them,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.680
it's going to turn out to be a great

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.520
investment.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.440
>> I'd love to move on to talking about the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.959
year that you've had in the world of

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.879
politics and policy.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.160
>> Um, the year begins with Trump entering

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.319
the Oval Office.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.120
>> Uh, I understand that your first meeting

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.959
with him ever was that month in January.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.400
>> Um, and since then

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.000
>> you've traveled the world with him. He's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.000
referred to you as a close friend and a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.319
great leader. And I'm curious, having

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.640
spent so much time with him up close

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.080
this year, what's something that you've

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.599
learned about his approach to AI and the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.080
way that he does business?

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.879
>> Um, let's see. I I guess maybe I'll say

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.959
some things that that um isn't evident

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.120
um watching or or reading about

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.560
President Trump on on TV or news. Uh

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.000
first of all, he's an extraordinarily

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.599
good listener. U he's he's almost I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
think everything I've ever said to him,

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.680
he's remembered. Uh he is an incredibly

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.640
hard worker. his work ethic. He starts

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.400
as early as anybody else and often times

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.640
uh we'll be talking about things late in

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.720
the night and I'm kind of ready for bed

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.879
and he's he would have gone for several

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.200
more hours and so so I I've never met

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.720
anybody with such incredible work ethic

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.000
and so he's you know he it just came

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.200
from everything that he's done he's just

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640
worked hard his whole life his whole

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.120
life he works seven days a week as far

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.760
as I can tell um there is no you know

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.959
after work spend time with doing

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.360
something else he's just working the

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.040
whole time and so these two qualities

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.799
are are really impressive impressive and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.239
I wouldn't I wouldn't have have um

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.680
guessed those two two qualities, but

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.200
he's excellent listener. He's incredible

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.720
work ethic and he's super smart.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.920
>> In the time that you spent in and around

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.360
the Trump administration and traveling

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.519
the world this year, is there an

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.959
important moment that you experienced

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.159
that the world doesn't know about yet,

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.360
but that you think it should?

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.519
>> The world is um unaware of how deeply

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.840
dependent United States and China are to

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.080
each other. Uh the the the ideas that

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.920
that floated around about United States

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.560
decoupling from China, I think is is is

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.319
is flawed. And our dependency on each

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.680
other is quite significant and it's

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.759
deeper than people think. And every

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.280
single time we press it, we realize what

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.239
else we're dependent on each other on

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.840
that. This will be the most

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.680
consequential relationship in the next

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.440
century. If this is so, um, I think that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.919
we we really ought to recognize that

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.440
managing the relationship and not

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.280
causing conflict is the most important

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.520
thing we could do. And so, uh,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.520
negotiations, communications, uh,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.280
compromise, um, and just the continuous

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.479
process of doing that is essential. I

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.800
think the current administration has

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.960
demonstrated incredible wisdom in

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.759
engaging whether it's he hexa in uh uh

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.240
with the military uh whether it's uh

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.000
Bessant and Treasury uh President Trump

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.080
himself uh ambassador Greer all of them

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
representing us engaging deeply in

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.759
conversations there uh deeply wise

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.080
deeply wise and I think it'll

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.560
demonstrate that a century from now that

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.800
impactful change versus isolation and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.759
and avoidance and uh I think That's

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.280
important. I think the second thing that

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.160
that I would say that the world didn't

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.400
realize is how deeply dependent we are

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.320
in the AI industry on the brilliant

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.880
students and the brilliant scientists of

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.639
China. 50% of the world's AI researchers

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.240
are from China. Their companies in China

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.000
wants China to win. I think that's

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.919
terrific and I think the Chinese want

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.759
China to win. I think that's terrific.

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.520
We want America to win and we can have a

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.440
healthy competition while we compete

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.039
compete fairly and collaborate at the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.199
same time. But I think the taking it

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.280
emotionally too far from that um results

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.039
in in consequences and relationships

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.680
that are that are just harder to manage.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.800
>> You've been still unable to ship uh at

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.680
the beginning of the administration your

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.280
H20 chip to China and had argued uh

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.440
successfully ultimately to the Trump

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.840
administration for them to remove that

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.440
export control. However, shortly after

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.600
that, uh Commerce Secretary Howard

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.160
Lutnik said that the goal of American

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.520
chip policy in that regard was to get

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.039
China addicted to US chips. Um and that

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.240
after that China turned around and said

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.880
actually no we don't we don't want the

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.800
H20 and since then you've uh publicly

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.479
declared that you have no uh China

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.319
revenue anymore. What was your response

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:16.880
to to LK's comments there?

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:19.199
>> Well you know um it's unfortunate I I

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.880
would say I would say um so first of all

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.680
it's really important to understand what

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.680
AI is. AI is not just a model. What AI

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.000
what AI is is a full stack of

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.919
reinvention of every single layer of the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.800
technology stack. AI is about energy.

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.919
That's the reason why we're talking

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.000
about energy all the time. When

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.479
President Trump came into office and he

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.639
was pro- energy growth, if it wasn't

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.479
because of his posture on energy growth,

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.160
the United States would have been in a

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.880
very bad way. We would have had no

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.880
energy, no incremental energy necessary

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.880
to grow this incredibly important

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.880
industry. So his growth posture, his

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.440
grow energy growth policy is incredibly

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.360
helpful. But we have to win every other

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.520
layer as well. The next layer is chips.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.759
The layer after that is infrastructure,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.840
cloud services. the liar after that um

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.360
large language models or AI models and

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.840
of course very importantly AI

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.840
applications. The United States has if

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.840
we if we hope to take advantage of this

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.599
next industrial revolution and this will

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.840
be the largest industrial revolution of

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.120
all of the industrial revolutions. And

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.759
so every layer of that stack we must be

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.000
determined to win. But if we allow all

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.840
of the layers to only be as successful

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.680
as the least successful layer, then

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.759
United States will fall behind. No doubt

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.840
our belief and what I've explained is

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.440
that in the layer of chips the single

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.360
most important thing is to make sure

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.280
that every single model in the world

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.440
runs on American tech stack and that the

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.520
American tech stack is everywhere in the

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.120
world so that you know American tech

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.599
stack becomes if you will the global

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.479
standard. There's a belief that somehow

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:48.080
if we provided American chips to uh

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:50.160
foreign foreign countries and

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.599
specifically China that the Chinese

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.240
military would be building their

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:56.879
military and building um airplanes and

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.639
aircraft carriers using American chips.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:00.400
Well, first of all, they have plenty of

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.560
their own chips and their companies are

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.720
formidable. The idea that China does not

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.599
have technology industry we now know is

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.240
lunacy and we all the idea that China is

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:11.759
not able to manufacture would suggest

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.319
somebody has had their head deeply in

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:17.280
the sand. The ability for us to engage

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:19.759
the China market, compete freely there,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.160
earn our business, earn our business is

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:24.240
great for um great for market. It's

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.560
great for the American people. It allows

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.319
us to uh generate revenues for the

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.160
United States. And as you know, the

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:31.919
country that is most secure, has the

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.680
mightiest military is because it's also

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:35.519
the wealthiest country. And so we want

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.360
America to be the wealthiest country so

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:39.360
that we can fund the mightiest military.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.880
And I I think that that is our way of

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.919
contributing to national security. But

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.440
this is a tight rope that you're

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.519
walking, right? Because you saying this

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.800
precisely what China wants is to have

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:47.279
its own semiconductor.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.480
>> I know it

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:50.720
>> industry. I know it.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.000
>> So in a way it wasn't Lutnik only just

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.000
kind of saying the quiet part out.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.240
>> You're exactly right. In a lot of ways

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.480
um we realize that that uh on the one

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.240
hand we would like to limit American

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.000
technology to China. On the other hand,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.080
we would like to participate in their

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.080
market. It is exactly the opposite for

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.760
them. They would like their Chinese

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.160
companies to have access to the best

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.640
technology so that different layers of

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.880
the AI stack can flourish um and it

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.480
gives while it gives their local

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.320
technology companies an opportunity to

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.080
catch up. They would like to access

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.160
American technology but they would also

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.560
like to dominate their own market. And

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.240
so these two ideas are are true in both

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.640
countries. And so the the the best

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.320
answer the best answer uh is to let let

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.160
the system work itself out. I think the

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.560
u we need a nuanced answer, nuanced

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.320
policy where uh America has American

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.080
companies have access to the most

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.720
advanced technology, American

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.800
technology. Meanwhile, um allowing

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.200
American companies to go participate in

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.480
the world's second largest market and um

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.920
uh and we'd appreciate the opportunity

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.200
to come compete and go earn our

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.440
opportunities there.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.600
>> I want to switch gears now to talk about

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.760
uh the social impacts of AI. Um, this is

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.600
a technology that has the potential to

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.839
automate many aspects of human labor

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.560
very soon. And I'm curious the degree to

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:03.680
which you feel a responsibility for

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.800
making that transition go well.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.440
>> What AI will do is to make tasks that we

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.760
do in our job more efficient. Our job is

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.079
not to wrangle a spreadsheet. Our job is

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.000
not to type into a keyboard. Our job is

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:18.160
generally more meaningful than that. I'm

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.760
fairly confident that AI will drive

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.519
productivity, revenue growth, and

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.079
therefore more hiring. There's a belief

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:25.760
that the world's GDP is somehow limited

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:27.519
at a hundred trillion dollars. Well,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.720
what's likely to happen is AI is going

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:31.279
to cause that hundred trillion dollars

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.680
to become $200 trillion, $300 trillion,

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:36.000
$500 trillion. There's no fundamental

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.000
limit to the size of a GDP. And so, and

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.079
the the number of people in the world

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.920
that is participating in this GDP and

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:43.760
the hundred trillion dollar GDP GDP is

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.279
actually quite small. And so what if we

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.640
brought the rest of the world, the rest

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:49.040
of society, the rest of the world's

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.560
population, empower them with AI, give

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.040
them the opportunity to participate in

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.720
the GDP and cause this GDP to quintuple.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.640
I think that's a very likely outcome.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.320
And it's very likely that companies will

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.760
become more prosperous. But it's for

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.600
certain. This is for certain.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.440
Everybody's jobs will change as a result

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.800
of AI. Some jobs will disappear.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.800
Obviously, every single industrial

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.000
revolution, some jobs are just gone and

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.680
but a whole bunch of new jobs are

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.720
created. Everybody will have to use AI

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.079
because if you don't use AI, you're

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.399
gonna lose your job to somebody who

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:15.360
does.

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:17.440
>> Maybe my final question, uh, Nvidia is

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.560
Latin for envy.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.440
>> It feels like you're on top of the world

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.920
right now. Is there anything you're

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.360
envious of?

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.720
>> You know, as I'm reflecting on I have a

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.560
pretty great life. I have an incredible

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.959
family. I've known my wife since I was

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.800
17. Um, I've got two amazing kids, 34

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:30.160
and 35. Uh, although they didn't start

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.160
out working at NVIDIA, both of them work

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.640
at Nvidia today. and and to be able to

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.959
work hard and work hard with your kids

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.040
on very important things and watch them

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:40.880
come up with with incredible ideas,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.120
unique ideas, and do things that you

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.920
never knew you could do yourself. Um to

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.920
watch them do that and um it is it just

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.720
brings me enormous joy. I obviously have

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.640
a great company to to to be part of. Uh

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.399
we're we're uh building the most

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.560
impactful technology the world's ever

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:57.600
known. Uh to be at the center of that is

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.519
a great privilege and a great

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.480
responsibility and of course comes with

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:04.880
a great joy. And um uh and I have the

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.720
support of of uh 40,000 employees. We

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.120
have incredible retention. I've worked

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.279
with many of them, multiple decades. And

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.240
uh I've got two great dogs, you know,

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.120
and and

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.720
>> most importantly,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.560
>> yeah, I've got two great dogs. They both

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.639
had their ultrasound today. They're

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.320
apparently quite healthy. Uh you know,

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:22.959
Lori takes incredible care of them and

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.120
they're they're super fit. I Let's see.

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:28.240
What else can I think of? You know, uh I

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.839
I have access to uh to friends and and

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.480
partners all over the world. I get to

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:35.360
travel. Um, I get to go to night

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.120
markets. I get to enjoy fried chicken in

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.120
Korea. I mean, what else does anybody

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.519
want? You know, I think this is this is

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.480
actually I would say for for any human,

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:44.480
this would be a dream come
