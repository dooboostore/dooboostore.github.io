00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
[recording crew laughing]

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.130
- Hey, Vogue, it's Anne Hathaway.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.730
I hear you have a few
questions, so let's get to it.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.370
I love going to Rome

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.310
because as soon as I land I just feel joy.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.020
Any stress that I have or any worries

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.274
or anything I have that's
like kind of just been

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:22.890
racing around my mind,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.290
I just look at the history of the place

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.850
that you live with while you're there

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.340
and I just go, "Oh, why
am I sweating anything?"

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.260
When I went to Ethiopia,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.240
that was completely mind blowing.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.110
At that time in my life,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.880
I didn't know the world
could be that beautiful.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.200
Recently I went to Kyoto.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.820
I just felt poetry everywhere I went.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.720
I felt very peaceful.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.220
I was there, there was no rushing.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.083
So those are some of my favorites.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.190
I mean, you can't go wrong with water.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.290
If you have it and it's clean,
you're very, very lucky.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.123
So hydrate.

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:53.430
I also really love face
sheets and eye patches.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.360
The whole thing.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.100
I am the type who does it on a plane.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.636
Absolutely. I've scared
many a flight attendant.

00:00:58.636 --> 00:00:59.469
[laughing]

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.760
You know I had my Shiseido on
just before this interview.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.863
Just like all the time. Whenever I can.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.730
I'm not big on holding things with regret.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.900
My regrets are for like

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.270
if I've been stressed and I
let that impact someone else.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.290
Like I save my regret for that.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.700
But in terms of outfits, like whatever,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.200
it's all fun, it's great.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.330
And even if it's terrible,
it's still kind of great.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.960
I do regret when I show up at
a place and I'm overdressed.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.160
There was this one time though,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.330
I remember wearing an outfit

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.830
that I still think was very nice.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.750
And I wound up on the worst dressed list.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.670
I remember going to visit my grandmother

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.440
and she like saved all my press clippings

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.930
and she'd cut out my worst dressed list.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.450
See? Like even when it's
terrible, it's great.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.347
Oh, what's my number one comfort movie?

00:01:38.347 --> 00:01:39.750
"Blades of Glory."

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.700
The part at the end when
they're chasing each other

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.070
but they're wearing
skates, but on dry land.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.560
It's like, the physical
comedy makes me so happy.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.040
But also like any Will
Ferrell movie. Period.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.920
But also that era Will
Ferrell, Adam McKay.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.453
Yes. Forever.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.640
My favorite karaoke songs
are "99 Luftballoons."

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.480
It's really fun.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.010
Makes people happy. Makes me happy.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.940
If you're having a night

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.680
where like you're feeling
particularly on it,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.970
you can attempt it in German

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.260
and usually there's no one around

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.190
to tell you that you're wrong.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.980
So just kind of attack
it with some cockiness.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.580
What do I wear to feel confident?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.000
Hmm. For me, confidence
begins with gratitude.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.670
Like if I'm not connected to my gratitude,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.990
my confidence will not show up.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.150
I just have to say I'm
so lucky to be here.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.530
Like, wow.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.030
Just honestly all the way wow.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.790
Knock, knock.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.623
- [Interviewer] Who's there?

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:31.456
- Dwayne?

00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:32.289
- [Interviewer] Dwayne who?

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:34.127
- Dwayne the tub. I'm drowning.

00:02:34.127 --> 00:02:36.218
[recording crew laughing]

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:37.500
[Anne laughing]

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.690
Can you tell I have kids?

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.160
Those are some great questions, Vogue.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.199
Thank you so much and
I'll see you next time.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.782
