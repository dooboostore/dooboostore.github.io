movie furiosa of Mad Max Saga so Ana

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.240
when Queen Gambit hit the world when it

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.320
became the huge hit it was during the

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.799
pandemic so first it was quite hard for

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.119
you to realize that you were getting

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.079
International Fame and you had hard time

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.479
have fun with it because of the old

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.439
lockdown thing but after that when you

of Lisa Al guy for part two and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.000
especially from the outfit she wears

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.040
yesterday I can see that you're really

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
enjoying meeting the audience with your

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.600
movies and all the red cup eving MH so

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.360
with the movie hitting the theaters just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.520
in weeks are you ready to get remembered

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.759
by the name furiosa by the global fans

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.159
and getting even more acknowledgement

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.759
for your career good oh gosh I mean you

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.719
know I didn't even realize this until

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.840
you said it but I actually I got furiosa

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.520
before Queen's Gambit even came out so I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.119
got this job and then everything kind of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.399
started happening and I was like whoo um

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.880
but I'm just very grateful to be

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.000
associated with this group of filmmakers

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.720
you know I think that's what really

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.080
drives me is working with people where

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.599
I'm just like wow your brain and the way

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.200
that you see things and thank you for

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.760
letting me come along for the ride so um

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.519
yeah I'm just grateful to be part of the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.000
madmax family it's a very unique one

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.080
yeah as a person who watch the movie I'm

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
pretty sure everybody will be welcoming

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.280
you to Jo joining the family of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.879
appreciate it and same thing for you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.080
Chris there are many movies and many

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.000
characters that can describe you but I

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.400
just want to put it this way um I'm a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.920
Korean I don't know much about

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.319
Australian people but George Miller madx

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.959
mad XX movies and Chris hamsworth yeah

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm 199% sure that among the things that

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.239
Australian people are proud of these

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
three are definitely in and what makes

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.040
this combination more interesting is

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.200
that when you were already International

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.640
Star back in 2015 the latest instrument

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.360
of this franchise mad X Fury Road was

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.560
the movie that gave the pure joy of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.560
watching a movie instead of analyzing

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.519
one yeah so playing a happy role in this

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.319
movie for this director must have been

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.280
something special for you incredibly

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.080
special yeah

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.480
um when I saw Fury Road I remember

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.200
thinking I have to be a part of that

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.000
Universe have to work with George Miller

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.519
and the script came my way I read it and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.720
instantly fell in love with it and it

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.920
was everything I could have hoped for um

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.519
you know it's been around for 40 5 years

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.360
I grew up watching these films with my

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:39.280
dad um it's a piece of iconic Australian

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.000
Cinema um and so it's it's it's

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.000
something very special and it'll be

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.040
it'll be hard to top The Experience on

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.200
the next one and it must have been

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.959
really a good experience for you because

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.920
um I I just heard it from the interview

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.400
that you used your grandfather to Accent

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.640
you you used it to play a character yeah

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.200
he he had a very sort of um strong

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.599
nality you know sort of H H kind of

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.159
quality to the way he spoke um and I

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.319
wanted there to be something abrasive

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.760
about this guy and so of irritating in

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.480
his voice not that my grandfather was

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.280
irritating but um just pitching it in

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.159
that register outside of my normal sort

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.919
of speaking voice helped then inform how

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.519
the character moved and sort of

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.320
mannerisms be had to be different and so

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.840
um that was that was kind of the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.960
starting point for me as far as building

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.720
out the character yeah it's fun it was

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.600
really interesting to to see you use

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.639
that voice because we are so um MH

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.160
familiar with his deep low voice so it

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.120
was even interesting to see the new

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.720
sound coming out from your mouth cool

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.400
thanks talking about your individual

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.360
characters I want to ask you about your

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.520
character um anyone who has seen Mad Max

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.240
Fury Ro must have been at least once

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.000
curious about the past of furiosa and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.000
you got the opportunity to fill in the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.440
Gap with your artistic talents but at

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.479
the same time because of the nature of

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.160
this movie by the end of this movie

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.039
there are certain destination where the

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.840
story and the character has to reach

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.360
completely so as an actor how did you

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.400
find the good balance between being

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.360
creative and being familiar while

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.680
playing this one character furios your

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.440
questions are so good love yeah you're

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.720
killing this thank you very much thank

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.240
you um you know I I made the conscious

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.840
choice too I got the job I watched Fury

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.639
Road once all the way through and got it

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.919
like really into my DNA I'd obviously

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.400
seen it plenty of times before that but

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.120
I refreshed myself and then I chose not

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.639
to watch it again I would watch the

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.280
first 10 minutes of it but only to

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.000
understand the film making I didn't want

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.639
to be um I didn't want to get caught in

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.319
trying to do an impersonation of

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.880
somebody because then I think that it's

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.440
a you're ripping somebody off and that's

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.240
really deeply unfair especially to a

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.280
talent that I admire so much and then

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.720
also you're just there's no way that you

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.280
can win with it but I do think that the

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.680
costume and the look informs so much and

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.280
I think I had her so close to me and

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.479
then I remember on the first day when I

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.919
walked out as the more familiar version

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.440
of uh furiosa or the crew that had

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:10.199
worked on Fury Road were like I like

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.160
okay okay this is going to work you're a

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.160
bit scared you know as you're doing it

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.800
but then it I think it works so

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.080
absolutely it worked I like I told you I

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.960
was the audience and I think you must

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.000
have heard it like when you came out

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.000
with that outfit there was some out

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.720
during the audience they were like okay

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.360
she's getting there she is her yeah so I

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.120
think the global audience will

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.199
acknowledge what you did in the movie

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.960
thank you they will love it absolutely

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.160
and talking about your character Chris

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.240
um dementus he's an interesting

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.960
character he's a villain and he's really

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.759
bad guy evil evil man evil man but

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.360
watching a movie there's something about

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.680
misunderstood naughty naughty man

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.240
naughty and twisty mind guy yeah but

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.319
demented yeah but watching this movie

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.000
there's something that makes me want to

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.280
figure out who he really is and think

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.960
about his past life and I heard that you

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.080
actually got this script two years

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.160
before the first shooting of this movie

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.319
but for those two years you kind of got

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.639
puzzled by this dementus you had hard

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:15.720
time understanding it but two weeks

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.680
before the first Shi under the advice of

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.639
George Miller you tried writing a

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.199
journalist dementus and you said it

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.599
really helped you how to understand him

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.800
yeah so if you can go a little bit

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.680
deeper into your answers that you gave

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.520
the previous interviews for those two

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.000
years what was the most personing thing

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.720
thing about understanding him and among

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.199
the things you wrote in the journal

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.960
which sentence or idea or word gave you

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:42.440
the most um insight to this

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.000
character um you know he was he was a

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.599
he's he's a conqueror he's he a

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.120
marauding

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:51.639
nomadic um there's a sort of tribal sort

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.319
of you know mentality between him and

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:55.879
his The bikah Horde that in the

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:58.720
followers that he is a master and

00:07:55.879 --> 00:08:00.639
they've you know going from say town to

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.319
town or place to a place kind of

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:05.280
invading taking over someone much like a

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:07.240
lot of sort of conquerors and dictators

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.759
and so on through history and so we

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.800
discussed a lot of those kind of

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:13.840
individuals George and I and um and that

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.840
was all spurring little bits of

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.720
inspiration and ideas but it felt kind

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.599
of surface and until I sort of started

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.960
journaling as the character and a lot of

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:26.520
it was about the past of where he'd come

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.680
from and you know if you look at both

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.199
characters they're both in this extreme

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.519
environment But ultimately it's their

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:36.120
decisions at the end of the day that

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:38.240
rest upon themselves and you have two

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.479
people behave very different you know

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.240
both both facing adversity and and

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:47.360
extreme um suffering but one chooses to

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.480
you know be Noble in in their sort of

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.880
pursuit and and and honorable and the

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.399
other chooses just to continue to

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.360
express further pain or you know

00:08:55.399 --> 00:09:00.240
participate in further violence and so

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.040
on as had been done to him but you know

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.000
I think that was what the opportunity

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.240
the script gave me was to have a

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.480
character that had layers hopefully and

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.600
and and wasn't sort of you know

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.279
onedimensional and and we got a little

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.000
insight into kind of his backstory and

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:17.480
but it's there's an ambiguity to it too

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.360
he hints at it we talk about it but it

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.519
doesn't need to be sort of explained in

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.760
great detail it's left open for

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:26.560
interpretation I think your your answer

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.279
gave me the great explanation of the the

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.800
dialogue you had at the end of the movie

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:32.839
which you will have to witness in the

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.320
theaters and there things to uh to wrap

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:36.200
things up so can I ask you the last

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.839
question I prepared you have to sorry

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.839
you have to wrap

00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:45.200
up I'm really sorry okay

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.920
um I'm really sorry movies is there are

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:53.839
almost no verbal explanation of all

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.640
things happen in the movie but once you

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:57.839
watch the movie the world and people

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.519
living in it just comes into you and

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:02.200
this time you guys help him with it

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:03.839
because F furi doesn't talk too much but

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.440
from her the look on her face and the

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:08.560
things she does I can feel that what

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.760
she's feeling and dementus while he

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.760
talks quite a lot he doesn't he doesn't

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.760
talk about himself that much but like

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.320
you said from the few lines he talks and

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.240
from the few action he makes I can kind

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.560
of imagine what kind of life he had

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.440
before right so as an actor's point of

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.120
view how was it to indirectly presenting

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.320
your character and telling the story

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.720
like George Miller does with his

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.160
movies it was you know I think the the

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.120
main piece of advice that I got from

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.480
anybody that worked on Fury Road was you

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.519
have to trust George and I really really

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.279
followed that and he's such a lovely man

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:44.680
but this is his universe and he really

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:46.440
told me like you have to believe that I

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.440
can read it in your eyes I want you to

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.920
do nothing it all has to live in your

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.519
eyes and what's that's scary as an actor

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.800
if you're going to do that with somebody

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:57.480
you're going to do it with George Miller

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.399
in a Mad Max movie like that's the time

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.040
to do it you know so I'm I'm glad that

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:04.399
you picked up on them yeah yeah I've um

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.240
I played you know characters that were a

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:07.839
lot Stiller and had a lot less to say

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.760
and there was a lot more internalization

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:12.399
and and I you know take my hat off to

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.880
Anya because it I think it's it's the

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:18.839
hardest thing to do is to be contained

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.320
and still um express the amount of

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:23.519
emotion and story and depth that she has

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.680
done with this character you know the

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:26.959
sort of shortcut for me is you know I

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.560
get to sort of talk about it and do it

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:29.959
all and I can kind of explain all what

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.040
what I'm thinking which is also really

00:11:29.959 --> 00:11:34.240
hard by the way it's a lot of dialogue

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.279
it's a lot of a lot of trying to

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.320
remember your lines and something yeah

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:41.040
they both have their you know their

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.639
challenges but it um again departure

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.639
from whatever you've done previously and

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:48.320
for me this was something different and

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:48.320
you know next time round I'll speak

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.519
less see if I can you know emote a tenth

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.000
of what Ana had done he he also I think

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:58.000
that the thing that's really exciting is

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.760
that George is one of those beautiful

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.880
people who

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.560
I would hope most people get into film

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.880
because they love it and they love it

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:09.360
with a childlike excitement and vigor

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.360
and when you see George just get lit up

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.519
with Glee when something works that's

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.760
such a

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:18.399
beautiful um motivator because we're all

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.880
there to make his vision come to life

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:22.839
and he really is a a very special man W

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.560
I hope George watch this movie I watch

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:27.959

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.279
