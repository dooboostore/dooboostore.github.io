yeah and what was your experience how did

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.860
you feel when you left home at 16 to go it
must have been oh it was probably yeah emotional

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.479
all my friends were like where are you going
and what this was tell them yeah I have no

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:32.069
