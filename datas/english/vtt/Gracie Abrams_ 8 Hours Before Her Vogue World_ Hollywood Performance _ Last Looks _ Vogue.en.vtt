WEBVTT

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.310
- Hello, okay.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.720
I'm gonna break the trailer

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.673
and then we're gonna go play the show.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.228
Bye, goodbye!
[Gracie laughs]

00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:11.811
[upbeat music]

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:16.410
We're at "Vogue World:
Hollywood" today, which is huge,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.050
and we're gonna hang if you want.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.883
Join me.

00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:21.390
[upbeat music]

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.530
We're at the Paramount lot.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.140
It's definitely hectic,
but in a pretty epic way,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.270
'cause there's so many
people walking the show.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.030
We just finished soundcheck,
kind of full rehearsal,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.490
and it was the first time
I got to see all the models

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.160
and friends walking down,
so that was incredible.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.460
But now, we're gonna glam.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.782
Let's do it.

00:00:38.782 --> 00:00:40.373
[heels clacking]

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.417
[lips smooching]

00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:44.000
[upbeat music]

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.730
We're in glam now.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.685
I'm here with Emily,
mwah, my hero, and Takuya.

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:51.518
- Hello.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:55.170
- The concept, "Summer of Love" inspired;

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.820
everything about the look today,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.120
from glam to what we're wearing.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.560
It's nice to work within,
like, the confines of an era,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.200
which we don't necessarily always do.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.480
So, to send references
back and forth was sweet.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.320
We were sending lots of Sharon
Tate kind of eye references,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.410
and Twiggy, how her freckles sit

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.330
was exciting to us this morning.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.450
And then on the hair front, light texture,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.633
having less hair than I
did an hour ago, even,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.290
is thrilling, so...

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.438
No place to debut a cut like
"Vogue World: Hollywood."

00:01:32.438 --> 00:01:35.557
[bright music]

00:01:35.557 --> 00:01:37.980
"Summer of Love," '70s,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.000
my favorite album is
"Tapestry" by Carole King...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.560
Well, and I'm also wrapping
my other favorite album,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.970
so it's a little bit, I
feel like I'm cheating,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.067
but that's why I'm representing
both at once is the goal.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:50.790
"Tapestry," it came out 1971,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.550
and when we were thinking about songs

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.563
to fit into this section,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.830
that was one that I felt
very passionate about,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.850
that album as a whole.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.850
And Anna and team selected
"I Feel the Earth Move,"

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.510
and then it goes into "That's So True,"

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.090
which is an unlikely marriage,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.740
but it's really exciting to
be singing these songs here

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.740
and especially feeling
how alive the era feels

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.280
while, you know, our section is going on,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.450
it's pretty amazing.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.190
Everyone in their, like, joy
and their gorgeous looks,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.180
and there's lots of, like,
prancing around and handholding,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.480
and so it feels really nice in this moment

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.227
where I think there's lots of
darkness to kind of be like,

00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:42.485
"Oh, okay, there's like
light, and joy, and love."

00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:45.390
[upbeat music]

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.150
There's so many people
working on this show.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.400
You feel the energy.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.480
I like that it feels raw,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.910
but also being, like,
at Paramount Studios,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.920
it's like there are aspects
of it that are polished,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.870
but then in the middle of the song,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.170
someone's like pushing
a cart of costume down

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.540
or, like, you know, holding the boom.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.500
It's sick.
[Gracie laughs]

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.970
The way that they're integrating, I think,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.350
like film in general,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.660
it seems like they've
got lots of crew members

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.727
involved in the runway,
which is exciting to me,

00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:15.750
and I think personally working
a different kind of show

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.150
on a pretty daily basis,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.650
I just very much appreciate

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.610
that they're bringing a lot of people

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.594
who aren't necessarily always
seen kind of to the forefront.

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:25.500
[gentle upbeat music]

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.290
Luckily, my band is with us today,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.480
which just, for me, is like a...

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.749
These are my favorite people in the world

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:34.950
and also comfort blanket to the max.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.030
We're all starting in the back
of a truck that reveals us,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.690
and I am loving the drama of that.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.610
It's like subtle drama, but feels right,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.780
and you know, to be able to look behind me

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.430
and see Ellen, Casey, and Gabe

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.360
being their "Summer of Lovely" selves.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.741
It's really nice. Ew.

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:57.510
[Gracie retches]
Cut that.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.490
We're gonna finish glam really quick,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.587
and then I'll see you in five seconds.

00:04:02.587 --> 00:04:05.170
[upbeat music]

00:04:06.187 --> 00:04:08.670
"Vogue World" officially
starts in an hour,

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.490
and I am five seconds after start time,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.080
so it's down to the wire now.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.080
We are wearing a look from
Matthieu's Chanel collection.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.060
It's one of my favorite ones
that came down the runway.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.060
It's red, and floral, and
couldn't be more comfortable,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.300
so I'm very lucky there.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.900
And then the shoes are pretty epic.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.320
I am so stoked that
Chanel is making me shoes

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.400
'cause I'm gonna try to...

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.350
I, like, after we did the rehearsal,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.660
I did put them in my bag,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.150
just to pretend to go home with them.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.530
We have the earrings.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.690
They're heavy, so if, you know,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.510
you see me walking and I get weighed down,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.765
it's just 'cause the Chanel's too good.

00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:52.980
[upbeat music]
[camera shutter clicks]

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.050
It's really remarkable tonight to be here

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.250
for a million reasons,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.160
but I think it's unbelievable work

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.193
that the proceeds from the show tonight

00:05:01.193 --> 00:05:05.520
are going to benefit people
who work in the film industry,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.390
specifically those who were
in impacted by the wildfires.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.770
It's very close to my heart

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.150
'cause I grew up in the Palisades

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.860
and so many friends of mine
have been deeply affected

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.740
and friends of mine in Altadena as well.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.150
So, this feels really special

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.390
to be gathered at all in a time like this

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.670
to be reminded of the importance
of community in that way,

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.610
but for this reason in particular,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.764
couldn't be prouder to be
here supporting the cause.

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:33.480
[upbeat music]
[camera shutter clicks]

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.760
I'm gonna go change into my look.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.240
Oh, you're panning up,
hello, 'cause it's time.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.500
Now I'm scared.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.910
Standing up.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.500
Put fear in me.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.150
Hello, okay.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.560
I'm gonna break the trailer,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.513
and then we're gonna go play the show.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.107
Bye, goodbye!
[Gracie laughs]

00:05:52.107 --> 00:05:55.923
[bright upbeat music]

00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:59.256

00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:02.257
[trailer door clicks]

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:04.650
[trailer door thuds]
Ah! Hi, we're just...

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.483
Can you believe it?

00:06:05.483 --> 00:06:07.170
It's time, we're going stage,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.153
stage runway right now.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.480
Thank you so much for hanging with me.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.310
This is incredible to me.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.160
I, yeah, couldn't love this more, really.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.160
I feel very in my skin, despite
kind of molding to the era.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.580
Time to go.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.010
I'm hearing from Mackenzie.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.843
Love you.

00:06:26.843 --> 00:06:27.750
Bye, Vogue!

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.701
- [Crew] Bye!

00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:30.289
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!
