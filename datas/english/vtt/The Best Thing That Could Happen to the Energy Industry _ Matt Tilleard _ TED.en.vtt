00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:12.236
Our modern world was built on fuel.

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:17.876
History has been determined
by who finds, who controls

00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:21.596
and who burns the dominant
fuel of the age.

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:25.316
So the past makes sense
when you look at it

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:27.436
wearing fuel-tinted glasses.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:32.596
And these are not just
a really great fashion accessory

00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:34.036
for this year’s Fyre Festival.

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:38.796
They are, in fact, essential
safety equipment for our leaders,

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:41.356
as they seek to shape history.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:43.996
In the 1970s, for example,

00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:46.996
the oil cartel OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia,

00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:50.836
tried to cut off the supply
of oil to the United States.

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:54.436
Caused an instant panic,
a recession within months.

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:59.596
Trump was 27 when those lines
of cars snaked around the block.

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:04.356
Putin was 21. Xi was 20.

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.916
Our leaders understand, in their bones,

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.996
their power comes from fuel.

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:15.796
But now, we're in the midst
of the next great energy transition.

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:19.996
So who will control the future
of clean energy?

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:24.276
Who will be the Saudi Arabia
of this transition?

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:29.156
Well, through fuel-tinted glasses,
the answer seems obvious.

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:32.716
It's whoever controls the copper,
the lithium, the graphite, the cobalt,

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:36.636
the rare earths, the critical
minerals that we need.

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:41.996
But our fuel-tinted glasses are broken,

00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:46.716
because this is the first transition
not to another dominant fuel,

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:52.316
but to a technology,
and that changes everything.

00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:57.596
Now I've spent a lot of time
thinking about what this means.

00:01:57.756 --> 00:01:59.516
Our team is building

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:03.396
one of the largest distributed
renewable energy utilities for Africa.

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:08.996
CrossBoundary Energy uses on-site
solar batteries and wind to bring cheaper,

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:12.636
cleaner and more reliable
power to businesses,

00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:18.556
and CrossBoundary Access uses the same
technologies to bring first-time power

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:22.716
to some of the 600 million people
living on this continent without it.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:28.196
And here is what I have learned
at the silicon face of this transition.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:33.156
Unlike fuel, technology
is less existential.

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:39.316
It's more circular. It's more fungible,
and it's more abundant.

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:43.796
So I can use one of our projects
to explain how this works.

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:45.876
This is Tolagnaro in Madagascar.

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:51.636
It's a remote town of 55,000 people,
next to a major critical minerals mine.

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:55.036
Power for the mine and the community,

00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:59.196
until recently, came from heavy fuel
oil generators on the mine site.

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:03.436
Now, CrossBoundary powers the mine

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:08.556
with a renewable energy microgrid
made up of solar, wind and batteries.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:14.556
Soon, we hope that we will be able
to phase out the generators altogether.

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:18.156
Now, let me tell you a story.

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:20.956
Imagine two cartels.

00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:25.316
One is real, OPEC,
which seeks to control the price of oil.

00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:28.436
The other is an imaginary alliance

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:32.356
of the major miners
of copper and lithium today.

00:03:32.556 --> 00:03:35.556
Chile, China and Australia.

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:38.716
Now if you want to run a good cartel,

00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:41.676
everyone knows you need
to have a great acronym.

00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:44.796
And so let’s call it the “pisco sour,

00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:49.636
Peking duck, Foster’s” cartel,
or PPF for short.

00:03:50.516 --> 00:03:52.876
Now let's imagine that each cartel,

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:57.276
OPEC and PPF, seeks to cut off the supply
of their respective commodity

00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:58.516
to the rest of the world.

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:04.796
In Tolagnaro, before
our energy transition,

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:06.956
this would have caused an instant crisis.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:11.716
Without oil, the lights in the community
go out and the mine shuts down.

00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:18.476
But after the transition,
nothing much changes in Tolagnaro.

00:04:19.276 --> 00:04:21.716
And that's because in a fuel-based world,

00:04:21.756 --> 00:04:25.076
constant supply of fuel is existential.

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:29.996
But in a technology-based world
without a constant supply of lithium,

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:32.196
your old lithium batteries keep working.

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:35.916
You don't need a constant supply
of new copper for your copper wires

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:38.236
to keep conducting electricity.

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:45.196
You do not require
a constant supply of new materials

00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:46.996
just to survive.

00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:50.756
But technology gets even better than that,

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:53.596
because it is also more circular.

00:04:54.316 --> 00:04:59.676
Approximately zero percent of the energy
from oil can be recycled.

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:02.516
You burn it, it's gone.

00:05:02.556 --> 00:05:04.636
But we don't burn technology ...

00:05:05.836 --> 00:05:07.156
we use it.

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:12.956
And so over 90 percent of renewable
energy technologies can be recycled.

00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:16.356
That wind turbine I showed you earlier

00:05:16.396 --> 00:05:22.076
is actually a refurbished turbine
shipped to Madagascar from Italy.

00:05:22.236 --> 00:05:23.836
And it works buono.

00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:25.276
Although it gesticulates

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:28.036
more than our technical team
initially expected.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.156
(Laughter)

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:33.796
By 2050, there could be
so much recycled supply

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:41.716
that demand for new input materials
could actually begin to decrease.

00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:44.316
But it gets better than that,

00:05:44.316 --> 00:05:47.836
because technology is also more fungible.

00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:51.996
Now, I'm not actually
talking about mushrooms here,

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:54.556
but the effect is magic,

00:05:54.596 --> 00:05:58.756
because almost every input
into this energy transition

00:05:58.756 --> 00:06:02.716
can be substituted
for another abundant material.

00:06:02.876 --> 00:06:05.236
Copper can be replaced by aluminium.

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:08.836
Cobalt can be replaced,
in batteries, by iron,

00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:13.836
and those substitutions have already
happened when, temporarily, prices spiked.

00:06:15.036 --> 00:06:18.836
So even without access
to a specific critical mineral,

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:22.636
the power of fungibility means
that you can continue to grow.

00:06:24.036 --> 00:06:27.756
Now, hopefully, you're beginning
to feel somewhat convinced

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:33.316
that demand for new material will be
fundamentally different in this transition

00:06:33.356 --> 00:06:37.716
because it is less existential,
more circular, more fungible,

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:41.636
and those things together
mean that it is more flexible.

00:06:41.796 --> 00:06:44.396
It is more elastic.

00:06:45.916 --> 00:06:51.316
But we do still have a lot
of energy transitioning left to do.

00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:54.276
So we do need new supply.

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:57.676
And so here is my final
piece of good news.

00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:03.716
The materials that we need
for this energy transition are abundant.

00:07:04.436 --> 00:07:07.276
First, we need less stuff.

00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:14.316
From now until 2050, we need to extract,
every year, around 230 million tonnes

00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:15.716
of end-use materials.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:19.036
So it sounds like a lot.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:26.196
But every year, currently, we extract
over eight billion tonnes of coal.

00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:29.996
Every year, we extract
five billion tonnes of oil

00:07:30.036 --> 00:07:33.996
and three billion tonnes
of natural gas, every single year,

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:37.436
just to fuel our existing energy system.

00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:41.996
So that 230 million looks manageable.

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.836
Now we are going to need
more of material like copper,

00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:46.436
lithium, graphite, cobalt.

00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:50.876
But this is the second point
of relative abundance.

00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:53.556
We've got plenty of this stuff.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.636
When geologists estimate
the likely resource,

00:07:56.676 --> 00:08:00.796
they show that it easily
exceeds our projected demand.

00:08:01.156 --> 00:08:04.996
Even rare earths are not rare.

00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:09.236
They were called rare because they were
rarely found in their pure form.

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:13.356
They were always found
with another material.

00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:15.636
So sure, they're rare,

00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:19.196
but they're rare in the same way
that Bert is rare without Ernie.

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:23.356
But is oil very different?

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.716
Our identified resource of oil

00:08:26.716 --> 00:08:30.876
is actually pretty abundant
relative to demand as well.

00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:37.956
And our identified reserves of oil
are held, similarly to critical minerals,

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:40.356
in a very concentrated set of hands.

00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:42.116
So what is different?

00:08:42.476 --> 00:08:43.916
Well, two things.

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:48.036
One, the resource
that we have identified of oil

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:52.436
is the result of searching for it
intensively for over 100 years.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:57.396
And we know that oil in general
is quite rare in the Earth's crust.

00:08:58.196 --> 00:09:02.156
We know that most critical minerals
are actually geologically abundant

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:03.436
in the Earth's crust,

00:09:03.556 --> 00:09:07.676
and we've really only just begun exploring
for many of them at scale.

00:09:08.476 --> 00:09:13.196
So it's extremely likely
that if we try, we can diversify.

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:20.156
But second, if we're confronted
with the behavior of a PPF-style cartel,

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:23.356
that angry kangaroo who I think
maybe was a little bit drunk ...

00:09:24.876 --> 00:09:29.516
the elasticity of demand gives us the time

00:09:29.556 --> 00:09:34.676
and the leverage that we need to break
the cartel or diversify our supply.

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:42.156
Now, there will be short-term
mismatches between supply and demand,

00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:46.036
but control really matters

00:09:46.036 --> 00:09:50.676
when supply is scarce
and demand is inelastic.

00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:55.796
When supply is abundant
and demand is elastic,

00:09:55.836 --> 00:09:59.276
control will always be temporary.

00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:04.636
Here's one final piece of evidence
that can tie all of this together.

00:10:04.836 --> 00:10:09.036
Can you name me a successful
cartel for an energy-transition mineral?

00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:13.596
Have you, for instance,
heard of these famous copper cartels,

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:17.716
the Secrétan Copper Syndicate,
the Amalgamated Copper Company,

00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:21.156
the Copper Exporters Association,
the Copper Exporters Incorporated

00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:24.956
and the not particularly creatively named
International Copper Cartel.

00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:26.236
(Laughter)

00:10:26.276 --> 00:10:28.916
These are all real cartels,

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:32.116
and they all failed,

00:10:32.116 --> 00:10:37.956
because when supply is abundant
and demand is elastic,

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:40.236
a cartel has the lifespan

00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:42.436
of your average
"Game of Thrones" character.

00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:43.916
(Laughter)

00:10:43.956 --> 00:10:48.436
There will not be an OPEC for renewables.

00:10:48.596 --> 00:10:49.756
OK, fine.

00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:53.436
But won't there be a Saudi Arabia
of manufacturing in this transition?

00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:55.756
Well, no, at least not
for the same reasons.

00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:59.516
Because manufacturing
is effectively abundant,

00:10:59.556 --> 00:11:04.556
your ability to manufacture does not
constrain my ability to manufacture.

00:11:04.556 --> 00:11:06.436
It's not zero-sum.

00:11:06.516 --> 00:11:10.036
Nobody can stop you
from making solar panels.

00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:16.516
Now building, being good at building
and making things creates wealth,

00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:18.196
and wealth can lead to power.

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:20.956
But in this transition,

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:25.036
it matters so much less what you have

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:28.556
and so much more what you do.

00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:31.116
The great nations of tomorrow

00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:34.476
will not be those that focus
on controlling materials

00:11:34.516 --> 00:11:36.676
and constraining the growth of others.

00:11:36.836 --> 00:11:39.796
The great nations of tomorrow
will be those that focus

00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:41.756
on their comparative advantage.

00:11:41.796 --> 00:11:45.876
Identify and unlock the resources
that we'll all need.

00:11:46.796 --> 00:11:51.556
Invent, build and manufacture
the technology that we'll all need,

00:11:51.596 --> 00:11:55.316
and then sell it
at great prices, terrific prices --

00:11:55.356 --> 00:11:57.036
(Laughter)

00:11:57.076 --> 00:11:58.876
to the rest of the world.

00:11:58.916 --> 00:12:02.356
That's what policymakers should focus on,

00:12:02.396 --> 00:12:07.236
not annexing another source
of not particularly rare earths.

00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:10.076
The leaders we need now are explorers ...

00:12:11.276 --> 00:12:12.436
not exploiters.

00:12:13.076 --> 00:12:15.596
They are builders, not worriers.

00:12:15.596 --> 00:12:18.356
And they are innovators, not conquerors.

00:12:18.956 --> 00:12:22.316
So let's take off
those fuel-tinted glasses together.

00:12:23.196 --> 00:12:26.996
Who will control the future
of clean energy?

00:12:27.756 --> 00:12:30.476
Well, the answer is nobody.

00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:34.956
And the answer can be everybody.

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:37.996
Because the future of energy
is not controlled.

00:12:38.036 --> 00:12:39.196
It's shared.

00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:41.636
It's not extracted, it's built,

00:12:41.676 --> 00:12:44.316
and it can belong to all of us.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:45.756
Thank you.

00:12:45.756 --> 00:12:48.316
(Cheers and applause)
