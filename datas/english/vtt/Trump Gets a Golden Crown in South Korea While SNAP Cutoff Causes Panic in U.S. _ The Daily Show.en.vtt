00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.235
Today, Trump was
in South Korea,

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:05.638
where he was dismayed to learn
that the hot Demon Hunter babes

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.140
are, in fact, not real people.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.576
But don't worry.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.211
He's still got a warm welcome.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.146
And the South
Koreans even honored

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.415
our rich American heritage.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.017
REPORTER: Overnight,
President Trump,

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.752
touching down in South
Korea, greeted

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.453
with the "YMCA" on the tarmac.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.957
[BAND PLAYING "YMCA"]

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.226
Unbelievable.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.696
The Village People
must be so proud

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.264
that their song
became America's

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.866
official presidential anthem.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.069
To think when they
wrote it, they just

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.971
wanted to make a jaunty
tune about getting

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.205
railed at the gym.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.075
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.377
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.378
Who knew?

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:50.350
But this is how it's been
at every stop on the trip.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.351
Trump arrives.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.952
They throw a big party for him.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:56.056
Then they immediately try to
buy his affection with gifts.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.658
So South Korea,
what do you got?

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.326
REPORTER: Korean President
Lee lavishing Trump

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.430
with gifts, including
a replica of a golden crown.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.231
We present this
gold crown to you

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.535
on this joyous occasion of
your state visit to Gyeongju.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.836
Thank you very
much, everybody.

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:10.837
I appreciate it.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.340
Wow!

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.276
A golden crown!

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:20.413
What a lovely, thoughtful
gift for our president.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.316
South Korea, can I just talk
to you over here real quick.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.452
Hey!

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.619
South Korea!

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.121
What the [BLEEP] are you doing?

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.589
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.526
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.664
Seriously All right, we have
been trying real hard over here

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:41.668
to gently steer our president
away from the whole king thing.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.838
And then you come along
all, hey, President Trump,

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.172
check out this cool crown.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.173
Try it on.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.174
Take it home with you.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.143
Not helping!

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.512
Please, just give
him a sack of money

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:55.415
like a normal country
and stop [BLEEP] up our shit.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.885
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.189
Everything's great.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.291
We were just having
a little chat.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.293
Anyway, while Trump is
collecting more items

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.329
for his dress-up
bin, back at home,

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.464
the government shutdown
has stretched to day

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:14.968
29, or what we think is 29.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.804
The guy who counts the days
has been furloughed.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.839
Now, so far, many
Americans have

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.342
been insulated from the worst
effects of the shutdown.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.477
The airports are
mostly still running.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.779
Social Security checks
are still going out.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.748
And the FBI will
still kick down

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.718
your door if you even think
about copying a VHS tape.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.321
But two days from
now, a lot of people

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.657
are about to feel
the shutdown in a big way.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.460
REPORTER: SNAP food assistance,
a lifeline for roughly

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.096
42 million, now set
to run out of money

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.497
by the end of the week.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.332
REPORTER: Food banks, already
stretched to the limit,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.834
are seeing even longer lines.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.936
REPORTER: A food crisis,
some experts say,

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.605
could be the worst since the
Great Depression, all because

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:53.606
of the government shutdown.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.608
Come on.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:56.609
Are you serious?

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.680
On top of everything
Americans are dealing with,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.482
now people might
lose their food?

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:03.483
Not food!

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.351
That's our favorite
thing to stress eat.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.521
But OK, no need to worry.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.323
We have a whole
government whose job it

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.758
is to keep its citizens fed.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.394
I'm sure there's something
they can do at this point.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.628
There's-- you
know, there's nothing

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:16.696
we can do at this point.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.798
Trump has done all
he can to minimize it,

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.300
but there's nothing
else he can do.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.235
The Trump administration
has done its best

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.970
to try to minimize
these hardships,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.105
but ultimately, it starts
to run out of funds

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:28.174
and run up against
the bounds of law.

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:30.243
And there's really
nothing more they can do.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.345
This is a national
safety net,

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:33.580
and you're talking
about it like it's

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.715
a return after 30 days.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.984
Oh, sorry the pants
gave you a camel toe.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.118
There's nothing we can do.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:46.793
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.664
So according to the Trump
administration the only way

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.968
to keep SNAP funded is for
Democrats to end the shutdown.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.370
And sure, I get why they
want people to think that.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.540
But what's interesting is that
when the Trump administration

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.176
needed to find funding
to pay the troops,

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.445
they shifted money
around and they found it.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:06.846
Hell, they even
got help from one

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:07.847
of their billionaire friends.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.583
REPORTER: The New York Times
reports reclusive billionaire

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:14.187
Timothy Mellon gave
the government $130 million

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.422
to help pay troops
during the shutdown.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.294
Our military
has a sugar daddy?

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.465
I swear, ever since
Epstein Island shut down,

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.600
billionaires do not know
how to spend their cash.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.405
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.076
However, they do
it, it's very clear

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.711
that when our leaders
want to fund

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:39.946
the things that
they care about,

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.514
they find ways to fund it.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:44.150
So I'm sure the secretary
of agriculture

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.786
has some ideas about how
Americans can feed-- how

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.788
America can feed its citizens.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.291
I don't want to speak
on behalf of my boss,

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.127
but if George Soros
wants to step up and

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:58.731
write a $9.2 billion check
to keep those benefits moving

00:04:58.731 --> 00:04:59.732
for this--

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:03.136
for the month of November, I
am guessing that that would

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.537
definitely be on the table.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:06.572
Oh, come on.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.007
Are you serious?

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.842
George Soros?

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.277
The guy's already
footing the bill

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:12.745
for all the paid protesters.

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.216
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:18.484
Come on.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.387
Look, dinosaur
costumes are not cheap.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.556
So once again,
our lawmakers are

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:25.458
coming together to say
that they can't come

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.026
together to fix our problems.

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:29.595
And as always, it's
up to everyday people

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:31.731
to step in and fill the void.

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.132
REPORTER: A New
Jersey food bank

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:36.069
delivering four tractor
trailer loads of food

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.038
to workers at Newark who are
not getting paid this week.

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:40.306
REPORTER: Landing
in Washington,

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:44.243
DC, World Central Kitchen,
Jose Andres's food charity.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:47.714
Often deployed to war zones
and natural disasters,

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:50.883
it provided free meals for
furloughed federal employees.

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:53.453
REPORTER: Now some have
resorted to unconventional

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:57.156
methods to help, like TikTok
influencer Kelsey Martin taking

00:05:57.156 --> 00:06:00.326
advantage of Halloween,
putting out nonperishable goods

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:02.128
like ramen
and microwavable meals

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.629
for trick-or-treaters in need.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.666
Wow.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.835
It really is inspiring
to see people

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:11.304
stepping up to help their
neighbors in a time of need.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.873
This-- this is what
we need more of.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.576
That said, if I was a kid
going trick or treating

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.878
and you hand me
a cup of noodles,

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.413
I will egg your [BLEEP] house.

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.950
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.687
For more on the fallout over
the government shutdown,

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:29.989
let's go live to our very
own Michael Kosta.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.860
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:39.799
Michael, this is
very concerning

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.702
that so many Americans can't
count on their government.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.137
Well, Desi,
our government may not

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:47.106
be able to provide basic
services, but what we do

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:50.943
have is a massive reserve
of reclusive billionaires,

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.044
which is good news.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:54.881
In fact, right now I'm
in the subterranean castle

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:57.150
of Thomas B. Witherbottom.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.519
He's the heir
to a railroad fortune,

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.954
and this is the only photo
of him ever recorded.

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:06.058
No one knows why, but we
believe it's because he's ugly.

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:10.096
Anyway, he's agreed
to donate $120 million

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.998
to help feed Americans in need.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:16.702
Oh, well, that's very kind of
him to pay for all that food.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.305
Yes, specifically chowder.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.741
He says it has to be chowder.

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:24.076
And thanks to Mr.
Witherbottom, Americans

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.579
can enjoy all
the chowder we want,

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.281
as long as he's
allowed to watch us

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.850
eat it with a spoon that's
too big for our mouths

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.852
so it spills
on our bare chests.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:37.857
He gets to watch us eat?

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:40.626
No, no, he has
to watch us eat.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:43.596
The slurping sounds
calm him and appease him

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:46.165
Mr. Witherbottom is
as generous as he

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.134
is a freaky, rich, hermit man.

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:53.105
OK, even if I was OK with
this-- and I chowder girled

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.207
a little bit through college.

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:56.275
But it doesn't really
solve the problem.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.743
We have a lot
of government programs

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:58.811
that need to be funded.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:02.014
Yeah, and we got a lot
of freaky, little billionaire

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:05.785
boys, like Thaddeus
P. Wormwell, heir

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:08.788
to the whale blubber
and baby powder fortune.

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:10.923
I met with him in his
pleasure zeppelin

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.692
soaring over the Himalayas.

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.727
He's committed 500
million to fund

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.329
the national parks
so he can hunt

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.763
the park rangers for sport.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:22.401
Jesus, Kosta, I
want the parks open,

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.570
but not if it lets some
weird billionaire hunt

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.972
and kill the staff.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.073
Desi, please.

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.742
The thrill comes from
the hunt, not the killing.

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:34.313
Mr. Wormwell assures me it's
a catch-and-release situation,

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:36.816
from when father
took him on fox hunts

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:40.086
at Blickenstaff Manor, on that
cold winter, when he first

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.355
learned that the dark
thirst within him

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.924
yearned for prey that
would squeal, not wither.

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:48.427
What?

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.229
I said he's
offering free dental.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:52.498
Michael--

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.903
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:01.007
Michael, is this really
what America has come to?

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.775
I don't want
our public services

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:04.510
paid for by deranged
billionaires

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.412
demanding something in return.

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:08.014
Desi, don't be so cynical.

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:11.751
Our billionaires have America's
best interests at heart.

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:16.289
So they'll pay for IRS agents
to collect taxes or the EPA

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:18.491
to regulate their businesses?

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:19.959
Well, sort of.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:22.995
But I did get word from
another billionaire,

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:26.899
Dr. Atticus Von D.
Yoreandshire Witzenberg.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:30.002
He's the heir to the Swiffer
Wetjet fortune.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:32.605
What the [BLEEP] is that?

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:33.606
Is that him?

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:36.108
Oh, yeah, he's super inbred.

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:39.345
Anyway, we were
talking on his luxury

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.247
Winnebago that orbits the sun.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.449
He won't pay for taxes
or regulation,

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:46.652
but he will give the American
people two-for-one coupons

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:49.088
on Swiffer Wetjet refills.

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.890
And all he asks
for in return is

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.393
that we play barefoot soccer,
where he's the soccer ball.

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:56.996
No, I'm not doing that.

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:59.332
Well, I know what you're
thinking, but it's not that.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:02.735
He just wants to eat our dead
foot skin as we kick him.

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:05.171
No, I'm not doing that.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.573
Well, I know what you're
thinking, but it's not that.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.574
It's sexual.

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:10.610
No, I'm not doing that.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.611
Jesus Christ.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.579
Michael Kosta, everyone.

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.414
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.416
When we come back,
Charlamagne Tha God

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:18.751
will give us his opinions.

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.785
So don't go away.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:22.822
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
