00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.880
Gosh, Millie, there you are.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.400
>> Do you know how to knock?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.880
>> You can't be in here. This is Cha's

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.679
office.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.160
>> Uh, yes. Yes. I was just straightening

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.080
things up.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.199
>> Uh-huh. Well, I'm Mororrow and I'm the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.600
one who's going to be showing you up

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.000
today.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.680
>> Okay.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.880
>> So, here's your pass. First thing I'm

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.920
going to have to get you to do is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.439
display right here.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.640
>> Sure. What's your sister's name?

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.560
>> Um, Stacy, but like want to just Yeah.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.840
>> There you go. Okay. You want a selfie?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.760
We can do a selfie, too.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.960
>> No, no, no, no. Drop it to you.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.480
>> No. First thing you're going to have to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.200
do is go make some coffees for the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.559
fashion team.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.200
>> Sure.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.200
>> Sure. Okay. Yeah.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.000
>> Look, I know that interns are meant to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.719
vanish into the background and staple

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.520
things. It's just not my vibe, you know?

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.160
I'm a thinker. I'm a disruptor. And I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.800
didn't watch five seasons of Succession

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.440
to just fade into the background and not

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.440
be in charge of things.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.960
>> Okay, here you are, Z. No foam, no fun.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.840
You There you go. This smells like

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.439
cheese.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.200
>> Yes, that would be the artisal oat milk

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.240
that has your name on it in the fridge.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.840
So, um, here you are. That's your last.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.880
>> Thank you. Okay, can I get you ready?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.799
>> Exactly. that. Yes, that would Let me

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.799
just I'll just taste test. Poison test.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.119
Uh, no, it's uh it's not lactosefree.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.960
I'll be back.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.799
Okay, Millie, this is the beauty table.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.400
We need every product to be logged and

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.640
placed according to brand and category

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.800
now. Yep. Okay. Here at Vogue, they

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.840
really value proactiveness. So,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.000
[Applause]

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.600
personally, I've always felt like I'm

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.759
more CEO coded than intern coded, but

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.360
you know, what she ever wants, she ever

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.799
gets.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.680
Look, I didn't want to mention it

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.880
before. Stranger Things is ending. And

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.720
of course, that was a steady income. And

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.720
so, I'm kind of looking for what's

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.120
around the corner. And um here I am. But

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.000
I I I have far more to offer than like

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.560
being an intern. I can't just like

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
can't do this forever. So, um I do have

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.959
a plan to stand out and I'm hoping

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.480
hoping it works.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.319
This is the best thing you'll ever see.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.959
This is trend forecasting. We're going

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.519
to start off with rodent core. Think rat

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.080
tails. Think think fingerless gloves.

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.560
Come on. Ail was on to something. Next,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.160
we have um Chihuahua core. That's my

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.160
dog. Okay, Winnie. She's an anxious

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.840
wreck. So, here's the thing. I feel like

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.680
we need to be more relatable to the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.360
girls of my generation. So, it's

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.200
trembling. It's like that bulgy kind of

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.040
eye like, "Ah, help me, please. I'm

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.599
scared. What's the world?" So, okay,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.840
that's fine. Next. Aquarium Core. We

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.160
have aquarium core. See, this was you.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.879
Come on. It was us. It was us. And the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.519
wet look is what I think is in right

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.120
now.

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.000
>> That I actually like.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.159
>> Yeah, exactly. I'm thinking slick. I'm

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.440
thinking gaunt, you know? I'm thinking

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.760
like I I you know caved and and soaking

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.640
wet.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.959
Okay. Well, last but not least is um

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.680
rotisserie

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.200
chic. Rotisserie

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.519
chick

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.760
word play. You see the word play.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.599
Feels like I've lost you. So, let's

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.440
recenter. It's the end of my day here.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.840
I'm finally getting some facetime with

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.760
Goma. So, she's going to be the time of

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.519
day all day. It's like what is she

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.480
actually doing though? But you know,

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.159
whatever. Um I feel like the job offer

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.640
now is just more of a formality. It's

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.959
more like NDA contract. How much do you

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.360
want?

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.879
>> We think you have a really unique

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.280
perspective on fashion.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.360
>> Yes, I agree. I have definitely a lot

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.720
more to offer.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.480
>> We don't think you're quite the right

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.360
fit

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.879
for intern. I completely

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.439
completely agree. I feel like I have

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.159
outgrown that role and I feel like some

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.159
of the other interns like they should

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.160
stay where they are, you know. But I

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.199
feel like I am ready. I'm ready for you.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.000
>> We're letting you go

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.120
>> to fash with me

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.120
>> to go to work somewhere else.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.639
Do I think I ran Vogue today? Yes.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.440
I think they'll realize that tomorrow

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.840
also. Yes. But

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.479
every great leader,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.360
you know, faces resistance. And so I

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.440
feel like this is just the beginning.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.320
>> You You can't still be in here.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.720
>> Yes, I can.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.880
>> No, you can't. You passed. Yeah. Give it

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.639
back. Okay. Now, let's let's get on our

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.280
way. Let's get out. I'm

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.919
>> done. I'm done with you. Mhm.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.560
>> Okay. The mug

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.250
>> I'm taking out.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:17.480
>> That's the mug.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:17.480
