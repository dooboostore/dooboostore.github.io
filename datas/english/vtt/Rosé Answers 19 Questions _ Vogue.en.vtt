00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.517
- [Staff] Hi, welcome to Little Ned.

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:04.980
- Hi, I have a reservation under Rosie.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.750
- [Staff] And what brings you to New York?

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.310
- Work.
- And where's home?

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.050
- I would say the plane lately.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Staff] What was the
last song you listened to?

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.363
- Wow, so many questions at the door.

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:16.030
[bright music]

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.010
- Do you know what you like to drink?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.950
- [Rosie] Can I please start
with a chilled vodka shot

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.000
with lime?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.010
- What's the craziest rumor
you've heard about yourself?

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.400
- That I might've had black
hair at one point in my life.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.233
How crazy.

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.840
- What's your favorite smell?
- My dog Hank and his feet.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.973
- Can you tell me a secret?
- A secret?

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.950
No, 'cause that's a secret.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.409
[phone dings]
Oh.

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.330
[classical music continues]

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.440
Ooh.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.090
- [Paris] Hey Rosie, it's Paris.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.740
I hope that you're
having an incredible time

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.150
at your Vogue shoot.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.490
And just wanna say that it
was so much fun presenting

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.500
Song of the Year to you at the VMAs.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.070
You looked so stunning in
your Oscar de la Renta dress.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.330
Did you have fun?

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.233
- Oh, my gosh.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.650
It kind of didn't really like settle in

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.390
until I think I arrived in Korea.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.500
So it was really all just like...

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.280
It felt like a whole dream
and you were so kind enough

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.150
to hand me that award,
and I love you for that.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.580
Thank you. [kisses]
[transition whooshes]

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.260
All right, let's do this.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.400
I can't do this whole thing,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.095
this is huge.
- No pressure.

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:21.677
[classical music continues]

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:24.382
- [hums] It literally tastes like water.

00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:26.910
[both laugh]

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.840
It's like...

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.770
It does.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.140
Why is that good? [laughs]

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.520
- Rosie.
- Oh, my gosh,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.045
Cedric, hi.
- So good to see you.

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:35.460
- It's so good to see you.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.590
- [Cedric] What is your
favorite curse word?

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.080
- Oh, well [bleeps]. [laughs]

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.100
- Someone would like to buy you a drink

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.660
at the end of the bar.
- Wait, what?

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.000
Oh, look, there's a question.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.029
Where do you find
inspiration to write songs?

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:51.728
Boys, mean boys. [laughs]

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:52.710
- Hi, Rosie.
- Did you send these?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.060
- I did.
- Thank you so much.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.227
- Of course.
- You're so sweet.

00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:56.670
- Can I ask you some questions?

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.630
- [Rosie] Yes, of course.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.380
- When was the last time you cried?

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.950
- This morning, or maybe last night,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.780
I don't remember. [laughs]
- Oh, gosh.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.040
What piece of advice would you give

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.840
to your 18-year-old self?

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.943
- To my 18-year-old self?

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.680
I was pretty badass when I was 18.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.390
I kind of like...

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.510
I still aspire to be
her, so I would just say,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.710
keep doing your thing, it's
gonna get you places. [laughs]

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.330
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers to that.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.750
Thank you so much.
[classical music continues]

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.950
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.350
Wait, are you kidding me?

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.775
- What does it say?
- These are all questions.

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:35.297
Are you...

00:02:35.297 --> 00:02:37.503
Do you have a favorite city?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.650
Well, I think it's pretty
criminal not to say New York

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.670
while I'm in New York.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.320
I do like it, yeah.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.022
Next question, what is... [laughs]

00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:47.730
What is the one thing
you can't live without?

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.810
I cannot live without my family, my dog.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.260
Are you an early bird or a night owl?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.040
I used to be an incredible night owl,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.340
but lately, I've been working
hard on being an early bird.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.173
How fancy is that?

00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:05.550
Ooh, not as fancy as this.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.440
Caviar, thank you.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.900
- [Staff] All right, you
remember your dreams.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.190
- My dreams?

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.760
I used to want to be a
primary school art teacher.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.660
It was my dream.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.190
Sorry, it was a boring answer.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.070
All right, Vogue, I'm so
hungry, I need to eat.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.960
- [Staff] Wait, one last
question before we leave.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.640
- One last question?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.320
You have to promise me it's the last one.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.030
- I promise.
- All right.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.633
- [Staff] What's a question
that we should have asked you?

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.004
- Well, you haven't asked me about "APT".

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:35.040
- [Staff] Okay.
[Rosie laughs]

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.470
Can you tell us a story
about you and Bruno

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.330
that no one else knows?

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.950
- Me and Bruno?

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.783
Oh, my gosh.

00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:43.290
I don't know if I'm allowed to say this,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.250
but [laughs] I had the
biggest fight with Bruno

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.400
right before the music
video shoot. [laughs]

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.540
But we made up on set, so
it was all right. [laughs]

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.550
My God, he's gonna kill me. [kisses]

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.550
Let's not fight, let's
be friends. [laughs]

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.430
Bye, Vogue.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.113
Please get out of my face now. [laughs]

00:04:06.754 --> 00:04:09.660
[Rosie hums]
[classical music continues]

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.483
Is there a normal menu now?
