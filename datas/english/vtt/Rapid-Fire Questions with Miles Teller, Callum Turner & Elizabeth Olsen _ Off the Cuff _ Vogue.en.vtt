WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
- I feel like this is the most sincere

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.340
interview we've done this whole junket,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.270
don't you think?

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.860
- We kept it for Vogue.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.671
- Hi Vogue, I am Elizabeth.

00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:10.504
- I'm Miles.

00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:12.780
- And I'm Callum, and today
we're gonna play a game of-

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.670
- [Group] Off the Cuff.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.740
- [Elizabeth] Round one, icebreakers.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.573
- No, no,

00:00:17.573 --> 00:00:18.990
no, I thought you were gonna
do the other intro for us?

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.823
Before you did that one?

00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:20.883
- What are you talking about?

00:00:20.883 --> 00:00:22.500
- You just jumped to icebreakers.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.333
- [Elizabeth] What are you talking about?

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.166
- Don't worry.

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.662
- What's the last song you listened to?

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:28.500
[Callum singing]

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.700
- Whatever that song is,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.800
'cause Callum's been singing it nonstop.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.689
- I think the last song-

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.860
- It is "Mi Gente" by J Balvin.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.110
- It sounds like "The
White Lotus" song to me.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.490
- Mine is, "I Know" By Dionne Farris.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.630
- How's it go?

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.463
- Don't worry about it.

00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:46.680
- What is an interesting
fact you learned recently?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.850
- You're more likely to get bitten

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.775
by a New Yorker than a shark consistently.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:50.850
[Miles laughing]

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.550
- I learned people that dig
the tunnels in New York,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.290
they're referred to as sand hogs,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.000
and it's a very dangerous job.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.710
- What did you have for dinner last night?

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.117
- Whatever they served us
at our premiere dinner.

00:01:01.117 --> 00:01:01.950
- That was really good.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.047
- A lot of things, there was
so many different things.

00:01:03.047 --> 00:01:05.700
- It was like Mediterranean infusion.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.553
- [Elizabeth] Had some
falafal, had some vegetables-

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:09.470
- I had a chicken shawarma
taco that was delicious.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.303
- [Elizabeth] Paella.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.136
- I went to the corner store.

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:14.239
I had steak, and I had Caesar salad.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:15.330
- [Elizabeth] Corner store?

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.163
- And a cupatini.

00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:17.490
- What's your favorite word?

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.750
- Fuck.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.583
- That's a good one.

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:21.363
Hmm, sticky.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.123
That's a genre-

00:01:23.123 --> 00:01:24.150
- Sticky is your favorite word?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.388
- That's a genre early call.

00:01:25.388 --> 00:01:27.385
- It's like, I learned more
about you in that response than-

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:29.255
- That is a John Early call out.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.300
- Than you wanna know.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.133
- Dosa.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.880
- Dosa is not my favorite word.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.380
I've been teaching Miles
some English things

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.307
and Dosa was one of them.

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:37.920
- And I think I'm finally
starting to get a handle on it.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.860
- Let's hear it.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.870
- Dosa.
- Dosa.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.190
- Yeah.
- Bloody dosa.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.900
- Do it.
- Dosa.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.860
- [Miles] Yeah.
- There you go.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.420
So someone Dosas around,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.980
you know it doesn't really do much.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.810
- Yeah, but someone you admire,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.820
I think that's why he
always calls me a dosser.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.370
- What's the sound you hate?
And I already know the answer.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.890
- Knocking, I hate the sound of knocking.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.170
I just, it feels like so authoritarian.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.030
It makes me feel like a
kid and I'm in trouble,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.190
and that I have, I just
hate the sound of knocking.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.355
- There's a way to also be like.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:05.940
[Elizabeth knocking on chair]

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.773
- That's a friendly knock.

00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:09.120
- Ugh. I guess when
people are coming over-

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.560
- They just slide notes underneath.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.908
- I see them outside of the door.

00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:14.010
- [Callum] I know you mean
on the trailer, like you're-

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.100
- You see them outside the
door? What does that mean?

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.933
- They can see-

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.380
- I have a window next to my door.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.640
So I like open it for them.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.710
- I like the idea of you
waiting by the window.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.700
- Me and my mom.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.533
- Always, me too.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:25.491
- For friends to come over. [laughs]

00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:26.393
- Me and my dog.
- Be like-

00:02:26.393 --> 00:02:27.313
- "Hi, it's open."

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.146
- Hey guys.

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:30.630
A sound I hate equal measure,
one I love and I hate,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.970
is a childhood memory of
being in the supermarket

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.647
and wandering away from my mom
and my mom going, "Callum?"

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:39.450
I, oh my God, like I'm so embarrassed

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.820
that my mom would call my
name in the supermarket.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.950
But also I love it because it's my mom.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.380
- Sweet answer.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.510
- What's the sound you love?

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.950
- I love the Sound of Rain.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.990
- I love the sound of a fan.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.250
I have to sleep with a fan.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.500
- The hum.
- It sounds so needy.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.333
- A fan?

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.323
- A fan, no knocking. [laughs]

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.202
- It's a $6 box fan.

00:03:00.202 --> 00:03:02.670
I don't think I'm the first
person to sleep with a fan.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.280
- I like the hum of a football stadium.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.101
You know when you're
walking towards a stadium.

00:03:07.101 --> 00:03:08.010
- Oh, sounds like a nightmare.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.775
- I was gonna say like
the bus before a concert.

00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:10.721
- [Elizabeth] That sounds like a horror.

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.087
- Yeah, there's a real energy there.

00:03:13.087 --> 00:03:13.920
- [Miles] Round two, getting personal.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.900
- [Elizabeth] Getting personal.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.787
- We are really in sync.

00:03:17.787 --> 00:03:18.990
- [laughs] Sorry, I almost
got you in the eye there.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.824
- That's okay.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:20.820
- I really don't, of course.
I'm not trying to hurt you.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.630
If you could be the best at
one thing, what would that be?

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.040
- Guitar.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.570
- The best at it?

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.890
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.440
I don't know if I wanna
be the best at anything.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.896
Then where do you go from there?

00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:33.729
- Well, I was gonna say cooking,

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:34.740
but then what does that mean?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.414
Do you then become like one of those?

00:03:36.414 --> 00:03:37.247
- [Elizabeth] What do you mean?

00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:38.850
- Like highbrow, you know the plates,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.230
there's nothing on the plate.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.270
There's no food, there's like a leaf.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.040
- I want to be the best
at drawing a straight line

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.390
'cause there's nothing you can do with it,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.490
and it wouldn't drive me crazy maybe.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.450
- Or a perfect circle.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.673
- Yeah, those would be
kind of fun skills to have.

00:03:53.673 --> 00:03:54.900
Like a party trick.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.570
- If you weren't an actor,
what would you do for work?

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.860
- I would've been a plumber.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.380
My mom, that was what she wanted me to do.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.190
- I think I'd like to do
some sort of interior design.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.870
- Oh like, I dunno, something with music.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.703
That would be great.

00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:09.690
- Do you remember your first audition?

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.950
- Yeah, as an adult I do.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.970
- What was it?

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.060
- It was for Gary Hines to understudy

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.550
Kerry Condan in "Cripple of Inashman."

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.080
- The first professional was,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.420
I think "Sorcerer's Apprentice."

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.490
But those college auditions
really stick out to me.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.323
And you're just sitting in the room,

00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:26.280
everybody's like mouthing
their monologue and stuff.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.113
You're like-

00:04:27.113 --> 00:04:27.990
- Did you go to drama school?

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.071
- Yeah, we both did, we both went to NYU.

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:31.110
- We went the same, yeah, and John Early.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.010
- But we didn't know each other.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.990
- I was one year older.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.910
- You were in John's year.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.743
- Was I?

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:37.993
- Well, he was in the year before me.

00:04:37.993 --> 00:04:38.826
- [Miles] 2009.

00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:39.780
- I was attention seeking.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.017
- What's your question?

00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:42.133
- That's a great watch Callum.

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:44.010
Cal, that's a great watch.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.843
- Thanks.

00:04:44.843 --> 00:04:46.230
- Yeah, you can only watch one movie

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.730
for the rest of your life, what is it?

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.050
- I hate this question

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.640
because it just turned
something you love into

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.200
something that's like horrible.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.400
- A nightmare.
- [Miles] Yes.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.550
- Well, I mean, I basically
watched a combination

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.570
of "Waiting for Guffman"
and "The First Wives Club"

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.280
for the majority of my
childhood every night

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.113
before going to bed.

00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:04.830
- "Sandlot," I've seen "Sandlot" a ton.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.600
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- I love "Sandlot."

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.390
- I don't know man, I'm just
going Adam Sandler here.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.250
I'm gonna go-
- [Miles] Keep it light.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.627
- Billy Gilmore?

00:05:13.627 --> 00:05:14.700
- "Happy Gilmore."

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.620
If you could go back in time

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.250
and relive a moment of your
life, what would that be?

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.260
- Meeting my wife.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.900
- Cute, how did you meet?

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.332
- We just met at a bar.

00:05:26.332 --> 00:05:27.707
We were both at the same like,

00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:29.790
it was like a black keys
party during Grammy's week.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.810
- Were you set up?

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.739
- No, no.
- Oh.

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:33.780
- You literally just ran into each other?

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.613
- Yeah.

00:05:34.613 --> 00:05:35.446
- Did you hit on her?

00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:37.440
- Of course, but I didn't
think it went very well.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.640
And so then I kind of went outside

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.170
to just hang out with my buddy

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.620
and then I saw her come
outside and like, look for me.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.093
I said, "Oh man, I'm back, back in."

00:05:45.093 --> 00:05:46.020
- Back from the dead.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.050
- [Miles] Yeah.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.883
[Elizabeth sneezing]

00:05:47.883 --> 00:05:48.716
- Bless you.

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:49.549
Attention seeking.

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.180
- I think it'd be
something from childhood.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.050
I think I'd kind of love to
be back in like my little

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.520
52-person class and make our history music

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.110
or musical that we would make.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.730
- I am torn between a few things.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.380
- Chelsea win.
- Yeah.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.420
And Chelsea won the Champions league.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.070
And all my friends, we were all together.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.720
It was such a beautiful moment

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.700
and it had taken such a
long time for us to do it.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.313
And it was pure joy.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.020
- [Elizabeth] Round three.
- [Miles] Round three.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.980
- [Elizabeth] Eternity.
- [Miles] Eternity.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.000
- What's the first thing you'd say

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.930
if you ended up in heaven?

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.763
- Thank God.

00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:21.330
- I would say, "Oh, you do exist."

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.760
- I'd say, "What a relief, this is great."

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.890
What's the first thing you'd
say if you ended up in hell?

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.970
- I'd say, "Oh, you do exist."

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.200
- God, fuck.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.310
- God damn. [laughs]

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.450
- [Miles] God damnit.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.675
You must've got something wrong.

00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:32.508
- Yeah, what did I do?

00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:33.450
- I swear to God.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.670
- Does the concept of
eternity scare or excite you?

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.660
- Excites me.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.760
- It confuses me deeply.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.080
- I mean, definitely the idea

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.597
of living on in an over existence
with the people you love

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.920
and getting to continue this excites me.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.536
- If there is an eternity.

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:50.220
[train whistle blowing]

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.613
- I love that sound, I love-

00:06:51.613 --> 00:06:52.907
- Gotta love New York City, baby.

00:06:52.907 --> 00:06:54.713
- That's that's an American
sound, we don't get-

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:57.870
- No, but the sirens
in Europe are so weird.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.703
- They're different, that's
a different frequency.

00:06:58.703 --> 00:07:00.427
- They always sound like
the battery's dying.

00:07:00.427 --> 00:07:02.850
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, normally they are.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.683
Budget cuts.

00:07:03.683 --> 00:07:07.200
- If there is an eternity, who
do you hope to spend it with?

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.970
- Do it.
- Kelly.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.760
- If I were to like do
a non-romantic partner,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.670
I would say my mother's mother
who I never got to meet.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.487
- What's something unexpected you did

00:07:16.487 --> 00:07:18.630
to prepare for this role?

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.280
- I died and then I came back.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.020
- I was about to say tap dancing.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.520
- I just naturally was
spending a lot of time

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.930
with my grandparents.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.400
They were staying with
me for a couple weeks

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.050
right before I went to film.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.270
So I thought that was a
perfect way to kind of

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.010
get transitioned into this.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.790
- What's a line you couldn't
get right during filming?

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.570
- There was a lot of holding
back the laughter behind camera

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.340
and letting the other
person do their thing.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.380
- Devine's the best at holding laughter.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.460
- She's the one making us.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.037
- Well, she's also not
Amused by any of us.

00:07:46.037 --> 00:07:48.630
- John's really good as well.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.520
What is your favorite
moment from the film?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.880
- The Dean Martin lookalike sequence.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.813
- [Miles] That was fun.

00:07:54.813 --> 00:07:56.820
- I think it's just unbelievably funny.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.420
- I loved watching everything
you guys shot together.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.300
I thought that was from like
getting drunk at the bar

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.340
to then physically fighting.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.350
I guess would be the reverse of that.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.270
I really enjoyed watching
you guys do that.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.250
- What drew you to playing the character?

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.470
- Well, I always wanted to
play a 90-year-old woman

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.850
who knows if we actually get there?

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.260
So it was really fun

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.140
to get to play a 90-year-old
woman in this body.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.140
- Yeah, I just really loved
kind of shining a light on,

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.720
you know, we described it
as kind of an ordinary love,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.940
but a couple, you know has
been together 60, you know,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.380
something years and the audience

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.480
to see them when they
were at their happiest

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.890
and didn't have any aches and pains

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.900
and just felt good about themselves.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.830
I just really loved that.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:39.300
- I loved tapping into the Gary Cooper

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.600
matinee idol of it all and
getting to watch those films

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.390
and playing someone
that's stuck in a world

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.990
as an undiscovered person
in himself. I liked that.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.550
- What was your favorite look from the

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.750
I liked my red dress.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.490
- Well I also liked that dress.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.930
- Thanks.
- When I tried it on.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.630
No, I liked my, I liked that jacket.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.570
It's, David said it was very much kind of

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.800
from "The Graduate."

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.054
I liked well-placed pockets.

00:09:04.054 --> 00:09:05.220
[Elizabeth laughing]

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.470
- Well placed pocket
will change your life.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.660
- I like my gray suit that went on-

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.890
- That one looked good.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.370
Have you ever kept a piece
clothing from one of your films?

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.320
- I saw a man who's maybe
like 78 or something

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.920
wear a shirt in the junction in our film,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.340
and I asked if I could have
that shirt and I love it.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.170
It's very soft, great pattern.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.470
Miles is really taking every
pair of Uggs off of set.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.490
- Oh yeah, yeah, Miles loves Uggs.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.633
- You just have a closet filled with Uggs.

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:36.487
- I do tell production, they're like,

00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:37.680
"Oh, do you want anything comfortable?"

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.546
I'm like, "Oh yeah, you know,
maybe like a pair of Uggs."

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:41.670
Comfy leave.
- Comfy go.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.503
- That's it.

00:09:42.503 --> 00:09:44.093
- [Producer] Are we talking
slippers? Like what?

00:09:44.093 --> 00:09:45.210
- Boot.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.770
[Callum laughing]

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.707
- Yeah, I always get excited and think,

00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:51.720
'cause you live in the
outfit for six weeks

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.920
or 10 months or whatever it is.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.060
- Six weeks or 10 months.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.860
- No, because you're doing
a TV show or whatever,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.360
and I think, "Oh yeah, I
really want that piece."

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.537
And then I finish the film and I think,

00:09:58.537 --> 00:09:59.370
"Ah, I'm never gonna buy it."

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.412
- No, yeah.

00:10:00.412 --> 00:10:02.040
- But what I did when I
was doing "Du Monsieur"

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.630
there was these two armchairs,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.130
these brown leather armchairs.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.306
- Oh, that's nice.

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:08.544
- [Elizabeth] Yeah, I've
taken pieces of art.

00:10:08.544 --> 00:10:10.422
I have lots of pieces of art from sets.

00:10:10.422 --> 00:10:11.255
- Yeah, your art's good.

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:12.172
- [Elizabeth] They also do auctions often

00:10:12.172 --> 00:10:13.005
at the end of sets.

00:10:13.005 --> 00:10:14.010
- I didn't steal two armchairs.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.690
- My mom actually bought my
overalls from "Footloose"

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.980
off an auction.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.660
- What's your ghost outfit?
What does that mean?

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.070
- Like if I die, what am I wearing?

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.460
Jeans and a vintage dead T-shirt.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.840
- I have these black crane linen pants

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.120
and they're just ripping
apart at every seam.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.980
And so I would like those to be fixed

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.570
and I'd like to wear those every day.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.830
I'd like to wear an oversized
beige, bro Cashmere top,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.910
and I'd like my Velcro
sandals that feel like clouds.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.000
- I'm going full cashmere
tracksuit hoodie.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.140
- Those are similar.
- I'm a comfortable ghost.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.990
Lightning round.
- [Elizabeth] Lightning round.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.655
What's this from?

00:10:53.655 --> 00:10:57.120
- Advertisement for a wedding.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.680
- I think you wore it at our premiere.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.360
- No.
- You wore it.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.193
- Oh, I wore that, okay.

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:03.990
- You wore it at a Vanity Fair party.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.890
- Crazy shit went down.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.330
And what about this one?

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.640
- That's Miles's shirt in a movie.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.156
No, it's, I feel like I've
seen you in that shirt.

00:11:11.156 --> 00:11:11.989
- Oh, yeah.

00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:13.215
- Yeah, dude, it's not "Whiplash"

00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:14.048
- It's not "Eternity?"
Is it not "Eternity?"

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.150
- [Callum] Is it not "Whiplash?"

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.184
- No. I think I'm in a
white shirt in "Whiplash."

00:11:16.184 --> 00:11:17.550
- "Spectacular?"

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.400
- [Miles] I don't know this, show me.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.350
- It's "Whiplash."

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.347
- Cute.

00:11:23.347 --> 00:11:24.180
- What the heck is that?

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.290
That's not even me. Let me see it.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.550
- Oh, it's from-

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.260
- Oh, you're so young.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.280
- How old were you in that movie?

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.265
- So young.

00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:32.430
- 21?

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.419
Bromance World or sitcom world?

00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:35.252
- Sitcom World.

00:11:35.252 --> 00:11:36.450
- Yeah, baby.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.550
- Relive your past or see into the future?

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.450
Relive your past.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.650
- Future.
- Relive my past.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.360
- Uncertainty or certainty? Uncertainty.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.303
- Uncertainty.
- Uncertainty.

00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:46.410
- Yeah. Never Or forever?

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.730
- Forever.
- Forever.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.378
- Well, it depends.
- Lightning.

00:11:49.378 --> 00:11:50.670
- Forever.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.600
- Think fast.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.010
Now or later?

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:53.972
- Now.

00:11:53.972 --> 00:11:55.830
Yeah.
- [Elizabeth] And later.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.027
- Yeah.
- From this moment? [laughs]

00:11:57.027 --> 00:11:59.160
- Later, because the anticipation to me

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.080
is like one of the best parts.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.063
- Yeah.
- Light or dark?

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.910
- Dark.
- Dark.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.110
- Yeah.
- Day or night.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.090
- I hate overhead lighting.
- Day.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.550
- Night, night going into to day.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.510
Yes or no?

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.440
Yes.
- Yes.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.490
- Yes.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.575
Thanks for having us, Vouge.

00:12:16.575 --> 00:12:17.554
- Thank you.

00:12:17.554 --> 00:12:19.247
- It was authentic.

00:12:19.247 --> 00:12:20.989
It was the real moment.

00:12:20.989 --> 00:12:23.572
