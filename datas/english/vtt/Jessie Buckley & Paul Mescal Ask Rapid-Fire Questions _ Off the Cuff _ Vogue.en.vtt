WEBVTT

00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.290
- A hot take, I don't think

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.730
a cinema is a good first date.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.518
- Why cause you can't- - No 'cause you can't...

00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:06.488
[both laughing]

00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:08.137
- Can't chat, really.

00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:09.323
- Yeah why would that make you laugh though.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.090
- Hi Vogue, I'm Jessie Buckley.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.610
- I'm Paul Mescal and this is "Off the Cuff".

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.857
- [Jessie] Icebreaker. - [Paul] Yeah.

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:16.690
[Paul laughs]

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.950
- What... - What...

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.783
[both sputtering]

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:20.940
What three words would you use to describe me?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.008
10 points extra if they rhyme.

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:26.290
- Oh heart, horse... [Jessie laughs]

00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:28.935
- Heart, horse.

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:32.310
- Heart, horse, super talented.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.404
- That's four words, alright I'll take that.

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:35.237
- Can I start again?

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:36.070
- Heart, horse, super talented.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.980
- Yeah heart, horse, super talented.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.260
- Great, none of them rhyme but I like them.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.500
- What's the most I'm an actor thing you've done today.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.879
- Having a ginger shot I think is pretty actory.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:46.950
Do you not think? - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.290
I wore sunglasses getting my coffee today

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.370
and it's like raining.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.100
You smoking is such an actory thing to do.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.330
Marlon Brando land.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.880
- If the fate of the universe rested on you,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.890
being able to recite a movie perfectly,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.020
scene by scene, what's your pick?

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.510
- We spend a lot of time over Christmas

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.920
watching "The Grinch".

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
My sisters can recite that like from back to front

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.550
and some of those lines have been seared into my memory.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.900
I mean, Jim Carey's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.770
a legend. - Genius.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.690
- Does Shakespeare have craic?

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.116
- Shakespeare has loads of craic.

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:17.949
- [Jessie] I think he has craic.

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:19.110
- I think he has loads of craic.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.520
- He's an animal. - He's an animal.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.600
I'd say he gets up to...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.750
I'd say he like has great craic in London.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.400
- Yeah he loves a few pints.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.950
- He loves a few pints, he operates off adrenaline.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.210
And I think people who operate

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.120
off adrenaline and then go craic.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.570
- [Jessie] Yeah, yeah great craic.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.280
- What's something you've seen on the internet recently

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.720
that you're obsessed with?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.820
- My husband's showed me these videos

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.090
of parents cracking eggs over baby's heads.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.621
- I've seen this.

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:46.500
- It's really wrong but quite funny.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.290
- And the look of like absolute like-

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.123
- Shock. - Betrayal.

00:01:50.123 --> 00:01:51.870
- Betrayal, yeah betray.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.950
- They're like...

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.840
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, what about you?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.341
- I'm kind of obsessed with baseball at the moment.

00:01:57.341 --> 00:01:58.174
- Oh.

00:01:58.174 --> 00:02:00.360
- Yeah got into a big Red Sox fan.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.810
Do you remember your first social media profile picture?

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.440
Bonus question, was it Bebo, MySpace, or Facebook?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.690
- I think it's probably Facebook,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.790
I don't know what that picture was.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.650
- Bebo, I remember Bebo. - What's Bebo?

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.670
- You don't remember Bebo,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.250
where it was like you'd have 20 top friends

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.750
and I used to put like girls

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.030
who I'd never spoken to in my year that I fancied

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.790
and be like, put them in my top five friends

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.840
hoping that I would make it-

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.673
- Of course you got casted in "Normal People".

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:28.767
- For Christ's sake, I remember being like-

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.500
- For Christ's sake. - It was so embarrassing.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.650
- If you could choose one Irish word

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.230
to teach the world, what would it be?

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.116
- Fáinleog is a great Irish word.

00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:39.949
- Fáinleog.

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.120
- For the bird swallow, the bird.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.910
I think it's such a gorgeous word.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.690
And swallows, I have a tattoo of a swallow that I love.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.830
One of my favorite birds.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.300
- I'm thinking about The Gloaming.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.860
- Yeah "Fáinleog" is a Gloaming song.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.750
- Is it but I love all the lyrics

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.779
of that, of "Samhradh, Samhradh".

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.722
- And samhradh Gaelic means summer.

00:02:59.722 --> 00:03:00.555
- Yeah.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.580
- And the whole song is about giving summer to each other.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.787
- Yeah. - Of like this summer of love,

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:04.983
"I gave summer to you in that summer".

00:03:04.983 --> 00:03:06.840
- [Paul] It's gorgeous. - It's such a beautiful song.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.420
So samhradh and you should listen to that song.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.910
- Yeah round two, getting personal.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.860
Can you split the G? - What?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.540
- Can you split the G? - What's that?

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.920
- You drinking pint of Guinness and you split...

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.870
You know what a splitting the G is, Jessie.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.270
- Oh it means that you keep the white thing at the top.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.430
- [Paul] Yeah. - I can't do that.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.020
- [Paul] You can't. - No, I'd be sick.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.643
Can you? - Sometimes, yeah.

00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:28.920
- [Jessie] Oh well done. - I can split the G.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.620
- What is something that never fails to make you laugh?

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.930
- People falling over in the street, it's funny.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.800
- Yeah, it is. - It's just funny.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.000
And then when they look at the pavement

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.030
as if it's the pavement's fault, that's hilarious.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.910
- Yeah, yeah, yeah they talk.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.027
- Yeah they go... [Paul sighs]

00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:41.370
[Jessie scoffing] It's ridiculous.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.500
What's the first thing you do when you go back to Ireland?

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.720
- I eat a slice of my dad's brown bread.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.017
- Lovely. - Hot out of the oven.

00:03:47.017 --> 00:03:49.160
- Lovely. - With loads of butter.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.060
- Kerrygold butter. - Marmalade, cup of tea.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.330
Where can you get the best pint of Guinness in London?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.500
- The Toucan. - Toucan, I think.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.020
- The Toucan, The Toucan. - Downstairs?

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.660
- The Auld Shillelagh, in Stoke Newington.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.493
- Yeah.

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:03.060
- What's a small hill you're willing to die on?

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.180
Like an aggressively small, arguably trivial one.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.040
I like that question.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.990
- I don't really want to die on a hill.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.080
- Okay that's great, that's a great answer.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.970
Round three career questions.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.370
What's the boldest acting choice you've ever made?

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.293
- I dunno, choosing to do the job.

00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:21.547
It's always scary.

00:04:21.547 --> 00:04:22.500
- [Paul] That's a hard question.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.300
- It's always scary to do a job.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.767
What film makes you feel the most nostalgic?

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.920
- "Santa Claus I". - Oh...

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.830
- My mom loves that film so much,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.050
and we watch that around Christmas every year.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.340
- If you could go back in time

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.290
and be cast in "The Office",

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.510
what role would you most want to play and why?

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.980
- I think I'm more of a Jim

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.350
than any of the other characters but I don't...

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.230
I would love to be Steve Carell or Dwight.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.490
Who would you play?

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.738
- I'm not up to date with "The Office".

00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:50.998
- You haven't seen "The Office"?

00:04:50.998 --> 00:04:52.859
- I haven't like... - It's worth it.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.660
- There's too many things to watch.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.493
- [Paul] Yeah.

00:04:55.493 --> 00:04:57.990
- What's your most irrational audition superstition?

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.750
- No, I don't have any irrational audition superstitions.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.320
- When I got the script for "Beast", I loved it so much.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.070
It was my first ever film and I kept it under my bed.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.450
I remember I'd read...

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.240
I'd like heard that Marion Cotillard had kept

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.190
maybe "La Vie en Rose" under her bed

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.480
or like "Rust and Bone".

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.520
And I was like, I'm going to keep "Beast" under my bed

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.400
until I get it, and then I got it, so thanks Marion.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.070
- Who do you go to for outfit advice?

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.430
- My stylist. - Yeah.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.170
- Or my sisters who are pretty brutal actually.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.003
- Yeah.

00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:30.600
- If you could appear in any franchise just for fun,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.880
but nobody would know it was you, what would it be?

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.640
- I'm thinking of like the first three "Indiana Jones" films

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.600
but I would like...

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.300
You can know it's me and I'm not like, that would be...

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.133
- You'd be fine with that.

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:42.482
- I'd be absolutely fine with that.

00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:43.315
[Paul whooshes]

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:45.018
That's the whip. - Yeah.

00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:46.440
[both laughing]

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.210
Guess the look.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.280
- I'll show you this Jessie, guess this.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.980
- Oh it's when I performed for the Queen.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.600
- You performed for the Queen?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.970
- Yeah it's when I played Liza Doolittle

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.860
in "Pygmalion" for the Queen.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.560
- Look at you. - On her...

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.270
It was like her Jubilee or something.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.183
- Unbelievable. - And what's that?

00:06:06.183 --> 00:06:08.790
- That is Met Gala. - [Jessie] Well done.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.380
- What is this?

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.993
What are those? - They're my Converse?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.870
- Where were you wearing it?

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.610
- God only knows.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.370
Oh that was my first London film festival.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.780
- Oh you're a baby.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.253
- I was such a little baby.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.233
What's this?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.890
- That's Oscars.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.310
- You're so much more like spic and span than me.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.513
- [Paul] Spic and span.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.552
- That was my Alexander McQueen.

00:06:37.552 --> 00:06:38.841
