00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.070
-Welcome, welcome, welcome.
-Hi!

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.905
-Lea, how's your mom doing,
by the way?

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:06.807
-My mom is great.
Our parents know each other.

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:08.742
-Give her my best.
-I will. I will.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.477
She's obsessed with you.
-I love her.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.813
-And your dad.
-Yeah, and my dad, too.

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:14.781
Aaron, Nick, this is your debut
on "The Tonight Show,"

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.216
so welcome to the show.
-Yes!

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.951
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.753
Yes.
-This is so exciting.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.688
Like, it was shows like this

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.391
that were my window to
the Broadway world growing up.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.460
So it's surreal
to be here right now.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.363
-We're so lucky to to get
Broadway actors and musicians

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:30.964
to come on our show.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.833
So thank you so much
for doing this.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.535
And, everyone out there
watching, go see this play.

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.103
It's pretty awesome.
-Yes.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:37.704
-I want to talk about this play,

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.740
but also talk about the theater.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.175
This is the Imperial Theatre,

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:44.444
and this is where young
Lea Michele made her debut.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.313
-Yes, 30 years ago.
-No.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:47.848
-Don't tell anybody.
-Is it 30?

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:48.882
-Yeah.
-I won't say anything.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.150
-They won't know.
-30 years ago?

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.418
-30 years ago.
-In "Les Miz."

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.086
-Yeah, it was my Broadway debut.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.588
-Look, this is little baby.
-There I am.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.256
[ Audience aws ]
-Come on.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.292
-I know.
-But then look at then --

00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.760
Here you are.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.595
The same theater, the Imperial.
-Yes.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.797
-And here you took a photo
in the exact same spot.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.533
-But wait. But look.
What's crazy is behind me

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.837
in that photo in 1996
is the "Chess" playbill.

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.572
-Whoa!
-And I had no idea.

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:13.440
And then someone showed me
this picture.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.776
I didn't remember where
in the theater it was taken.

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.211
And Nick and I
went to the theater

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:18.946
a few weeks ago
for a little tour,

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.948
and I turned and I was like,
"Oh, my gosh,

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:23.717
there is the spot that I took
this picture 30 years ago."

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:26.353
So Nick took this picture of me.
-And now you're in ---

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:27.788
-Look at the playbill behind me.

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.423
I mean, that's kind of crazy.
-You're in "Chess."

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.458
-I'm in "Chess."
-It's all meant to be.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.327
It's all meant to be.
-I know.

[ Cheers and applause ]
-Wow!

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.997
-That's kind of crazy.

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.266
-Aaron, you said one
of your first Broadway

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.569
shows that you
that you saw was "Ragtime."

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.137
-Yes, it was.
-In the '90s.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.206
And Lea was in that show.
-Yes.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.510
I was really fortunate because
I grew up just, like, upstate,

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.111
you know,
and I got to see Broadway shows

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.913
with school groups, which was
an amazing thing.

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.815
And one of the early shows
that I saw that made

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:55.949
a big impression was "Ragtime."

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.084
And it was during the first year

00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:58.085
when the original cast was
there.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:01:59.820
So I saw Lea in "Ragtime."

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.388
-You remembered
my entire performance.

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:03.524
-[ Coughs ] Yes.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:05.459
I remember when you walked
on stage, I was like,

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.727
"This is the --

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:09.029
We're going to do 'Chess'
together in 35 years."

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.531
-Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
-Perfect.

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.432
-Nick, before you started
working on the show,

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.368
you and Aaron were
just together in "Sweeney Todd."

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:16.703
-That's right.
-So does it feel like you have

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.438
a shorthand when
you're doing "Chess"?

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.674
-Yeah. I mean, we got to deepen
our relationship

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:22.609
definitely through this process.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.345
And during "Sweeney,"
I was the first kill.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.948
So I was on stage for about
like 25 minutes.

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.784
-Oh, my God. It still counts.
-Yeah, it still counts.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:34.154
And I like to think that I get
my revenge on him in "Chess."

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.656
-You definitely get me
back this time around.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.391
So that's good. Yeah, yeah.
-Oh!

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.092
Lea, I heard that
one of your best friends

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.994
and one of our favorites,
Jonathan Groff,

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.663
had something
to do with the casting.

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.331
-I know. I can't go any --

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.566
I can't do anything
without talking about him.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:46.934
-No. Me neither.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.602
Yeah, we bring Jonathan Groff --
-We're obsessed with him.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:49.636
-We're obsessed with
Jonathan Groff.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:50.437
-We really are.
-Yeah. He's the best.

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:51.905
Hi, Jonathan.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.240
-No. Well, yeah.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.242
When this whole project
was sort of coming together,

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:58.545
I knew that Nick was, you know,
hopefully going to be on board,

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.581
which I was so excited about.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.584
And we were looking for someone
to play this character Freddie,

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:05.252
which Aaron now plays.

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:06.954
And if you know this show,

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:09.122
you know it's some
of the hardest singing.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:13.026
It's so hard, like,
and very complicated

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.062
and has, like, this crazy range

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.898
but his role in particular, and
I call Jonathan and I was like,

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:20.567
"If we can't find the right,
most perfect person

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:23.837
to play this part, then we
literally can't do this show."

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:26.740
He was like,
"You have to call Aaron Tveit."

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.576
And so I called --
I got his number from his wife,

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.079
called him, and here we are now.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.082
-And now I'm sending Jonathan
10% of my weekly salary.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:35.916
[ Laughter ]
-Yeah, yeah.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.684
No, no, don't give him any.

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.620
But the songs are beautiful
and brilliant.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.822
Can you tell everyone
who wrote these songs?

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:44.691
-Yeah, it's Benny and Bjorn
of ABBA fame,

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.593
Benny Andersson and Bjorn.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:49.396
And yeah, so it's ABBA music
with Tim Rice lyrics.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.465
-Tim Rice, Benny and Bjorn
from ABBA?

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.534
Come on! I'm freaking out!

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:54.968
-And chess.
-And chess.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.337
-Yeah, yeah.
-How do we set up
what the show is about?

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:00.140
-Yeah, that's
where I let Aaron take over.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.810
-So, basically "Chess" is
a -- it's a story

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.812
that revolves around
a world championship chess match

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.548
in 1979,

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:10.417
and it's looking at lots
of geopolitical climate

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:13.654
between Russia and the United
States and the Cold War.

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:16.657
And yep, sounds super fun.
[ Laughter ]

00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:19.159
but no, what it does is
it takes this chess match

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.196
between these two grandmasters

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:24.231
who are going for
the world championship,

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.999
and hopefully it's holding a bit
of a lens up to our society,

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.701
and we get to look at
kind of things

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.703
that are happening
in our world today,

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.539

through this dramatic lens.

a performance tonight,

do you have any vocal warm-ups
that you do or...?

for seven days, I'm in.
