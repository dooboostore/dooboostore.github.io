WEBVTT

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.480
Hi everyone. I'm so young. I'm one of

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:07.279
the co-founders of 12 Labs where I lead

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.599
our go to market efforts. Uh today I'm

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.000
just going to talk about video. And uh

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.400
video is interesting because it's often

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.640
a forgotten data format when it comes to

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.680
how we understand, utilize and analyze.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.199
Uh but I don't think anyone here can

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.039
reject the idea of we use video every

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.679
day. It's how we communicate. It's how

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.000
we, you know, tell stories. It's how we

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.719
record our lives now. Um it's how we

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.800
work together. And so 12 Labs as a

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.879
company, we were founded uh I think four

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.120
and a half years ago and we started

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.200
thinking about what can be done to be

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.520
able to contextually comprehend videos

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.840
at scale that allows us to better

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.360
utilize uh all of the knowledge, insight

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.520
and stories that live inside video. So

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.600
we'll go into that. Uh very simple video

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.000
dominates the way that you know we live

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.520
today. It's 90% of all the data in the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.199
world. It's going to increase. Um

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.520
and just as an example, here are some of

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.280
the industries where video is so

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.840
important. Um video ccentric

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.760
applications, video centric workflows.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.360
Um of course, media, sports,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.520
entertainment is a really big place

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.479
where the most valuable stories that we

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560
love to watch uh that we love to share

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.840
uh are captured and created. Um

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.560
advertising also um told in video is

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.280
incredibly powerful. Uh we look at

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.320
creator economy, um law enforcement, how

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.880
do we stay safe, uh be able to manage

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.680
evidence, do investigations, um

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.840
healthcare, automotive, um enterprise

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.880
knowledge all in the form of video.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.360
But here's the problem which was uh even

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.119
if we know that video is powerful, the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.360
technologies to be able to understand

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.920
video used to rely on frame

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.000
understanding. So if we assume maybe a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.560
video might have every second maybe

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.960
let's assume 24 to 30 frames. You're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.920
extracting a frame and you're analyzing

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.920
what objects are in a frame. Uh

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.759
sometimes we can even do because speech

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.000
recognition is very commoditized. We can

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.800
even extract transcripts from video and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.200
analyze the dialogue and analyze uh the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.120
language part of video.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.959
But neither is fully sufficient because

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.959
if you think about the way we see, hear,

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.879
and understand the world. We're

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.520
actually, it's actually temporal, right?

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.360
We see things that are changing, moving.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.520
Uh we hear sounds that are not

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.599
necessarily in language form. If I clap,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.560
that's a sound. If I say something,

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.239
that's also dialogue. Um but also sound.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.319
So, how do you combine all of these

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.920
things, put it in the context of time,

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.680
and be able to almost like a human

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.080
contextually comprehend what is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.560
happening inside video so that we're

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.879
able to use uh the context. We can

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.360
simply very easily search for things and

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.440
scenes and moments in video. Uh we can

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.200
ask questions of what's happening inside

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.280
and almost be able to communicate and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.680
freely use all of that context that is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.239
available to us because we're storing a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.319
lot of it.

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.159
Um here's also another challenge. uh

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.800
when we had started the company at the

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.879
time LLMs were still very nent but even

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.760
LLM at the time um and even today uh are

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.519
not they can't see the whole picture. Uh

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.360
language is very different as a data

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.840
format from video. If you think about

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.599
the way that words are spoken or said uh

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.920
every word has a meaning there's a

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.000
reason why we say each word. Uh video is

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.239
very redundant in nature and it's

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
multimodal, right? Uh it has all of

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.080
these different inputs and you have to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.480
combine them together and understand

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.480
everything temporally.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.480
And so traditional ways of analyzing

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.920
video um we talked about frame based

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.239
computer vision there's analyzing speech

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.319
um but actually what we found is that

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.640
most customers most enterprises that are

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.680
video ccentric a lot of the ways that as

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.480
consumers we find video for ourselves is

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.799
manual. Uh, so you actually go back to

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.120
footage and as you're watching it, you

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.879
take notes, you tag it, and a lot of

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.920
organizations actually store

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.159
spreadsheets of tags. Uh, often times

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.040
they're video filebased tags. You're not

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.919
even getting uh in scene invid uh

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.519
temporal context. Uh, you're usually

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.120
storing you're taking notes on what's

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.880
happening and that's really what you're

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.720
searching through uh years later when

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.199
you're needing to better utilize those

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.360
assets. Um, I'll walk through some

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.400
examples of a case study later on on

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.360
what that means.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.759
And so, if we were to describe things

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.360
that we need to find, let's say you're a

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.440
sports organization, you're a sports

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.360
team, and you're trying to find when

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.560
there's a touchdown happening, maybe

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.800
there's crowd, the fans applauding, um,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.000
maybe there's a really cool logo in the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.000
background while something really

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.080
exciting is happening during a game. How

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.759
do you actually describe and find that

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.639
exact segment so that you can create a

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:03.120
highlight from it? Um or so that you can

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.880
uh show it to fans. And the same problem

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.960
and challenge exists for every

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.160
organization that has video. Whether

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.840
you're trying to go through pabytes of

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.320
uh evidence to be able to do an

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.000
investigation and or write reports. Uh

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.720
whether you're trying to create and

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.560
repurpose content from older shows. Uh

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.680
it's all the same problem of how do you

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.440
understand footage at scale?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.639
Um, in traditional ways of tags, you

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.080
would not be able to do this. You would

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.440
not be able to describe something you're

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.960
looking for and be able to find it

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.479
exactly when you need to. There is no

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.199
control F for video.

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.800
And so the technology uh that 12 Labs

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.639
builds is multimodal video

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.479
understanding. Uh we built foundation

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.120
models that allow you to do semantic

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.039
search uh and retrieval across vast

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.759
amounts of multimodal data, in this case

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.520
video. uh you also are able to

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.360
communicate and converse with video. So

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.199
this is an example of a query that you

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.360
could search that you can run receiver

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.960
catches deep ball for touchdown and it

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.280
would go across all of those moments

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.479
that you have and pinpoint that that

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.280
exact scene.

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.600
You could also uh because the AI has

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.680
created a memory of all of the footage,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.600
all of the videos that you have, you're

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.680
also able to reason with it. So you can

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.919
ask describe what happens in this clip.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.160
What's funny about this video? Why would

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.240
an audience find it interesting? Um,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.680
create a highlight from it and be able

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.360
to extract response intelligent

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.800
responses from it based on the AI's

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.919
understanding of your content.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.000
This is a way of um so this is an

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.479
overview of how a video foundation model

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.160
will work. In the case of 12 labs, we

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.880
have two models. We have our moringo

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.280
model and think of moringo uh as a way

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.639
of creating this first memory of video.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.800
So the AI will see, hear and kind of

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.560
understand and almost create this memory

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.639
and we store these in the form of vector

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.919
embeddings and uh create vector

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.639
embeddings that capture all of the

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.240
context of video and these this memory

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.360
these embeddings allow you to very

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.520
easily search uh and find exact moments

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.360
um across your library. Then we have our

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.599
second model which is called Pegasus. We

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.720
like to name our models after horses. In

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:15.120
this case, it's a fictionary horse, but

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.199
um Pegasus allows you to then reason on

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.280
top of the memory that Mingo has

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:22.960
created. And so these two work together

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.440
to enable a holistic uh set of use cases

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.759
uh whatever type of use case you have uh

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.759
for your video.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.639
So one of the industries where video is

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.960
super powerful as we know is uh where

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:38.960
content is created and stored um media

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.800
and entertainment um advertising and how

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.039
we you know tell stories. This is I

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.360
believe also being captured in video. Um

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.319
so let's take a few examples of overall

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.080
processes of of content management. Uh

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:52.240
so one when you're creating content when

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.960
you're going from raw footage to a story

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.800
that can be told to many that's actually

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.720
a it's in some ways it's a search

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.560
problem. Uh you have a narrative in your

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.080
mind as a creative. How do you actually

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.800
go across all of your the raw footage

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.400
you have uh extract all of the moments

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.000
that are relevant and be able to put

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.000
them together so that you can very

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.240
quickly iterate um on different stories

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.479
and be able to you know uh put that

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.639
together. And that's a problem that not

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:18.319
only individual creators would have uh

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:20.160
but also the largest organizations and

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:23.759
the largest uh production houses uh

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.000
would have too. Uh distribution um when

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:28.000
we get recommended content uh from

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.759
platforms are they actually

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.280
personalized? Is it actually

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.200
understanding what I like to watch

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.519
because what I said I like to watch when

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.159
I signed up for something could be very

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:40.399
different from my actual behavior. And

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:42.880
so, uh, recommending being able to help

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:44.640
me as a user discover content that's

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.640
more relevant to myself that I actually

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.320
enjoy watching. Um, all of these are

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.240
recommendation and discovery that can be

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.200
powered through enhanced content

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.440
understanding. Um, I think a lot of us

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.120
are probably finding uh shorter form

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.320
content on social media that we're, you

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.399
know, spending a lot of time scroll

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.800
through. I know scrolling through. I

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:04.880
know I am. Content repackaging and

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.480
monetization. How do you actually

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.920
repurpose all of these incredible

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.560
stories that have been created in the

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.120
past into more digestible and consumable

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.959
format that is more personal and because

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.839
you can do this at scale it becomes more

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:20.720
personalized um way for me to consume as

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:23.040
a viewer. Uh these are all challenges

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.560
that we find uh challenges or

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.880
opportunity as you can call you can call

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.920
it opportunity that our customers have

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.279
that uh enhanced contextual intelligent

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.240
video understanding is able to help

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:37.040
with. And so for 12 labs, we build the

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.200
AI that can understand video um and we

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.040
provide the technology in forms of APIs

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.880
that allow our customers and partners to

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.440
be able to build on top of the

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.800
technology that we have.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.760
So really quickly, I'm going to go

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.200
through an example um of a customer case

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.519
study. So Maple Leaf Sports

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.279
Entertainment is uh one of the largest

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:57.120
sports entities in Canada. Um, if

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:59.360
anyone's here from Canada, uh, they have

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.440
the NBA team, Toronto Raptors, Maple

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.440
Leafs, which is an NHL team.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.920
And just like many other content or

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.720
media organizations, the challenge is

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.880
after every game. Um, and there's also a

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.120
huge historical archive there as well.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.200
Uh, how do you actually access the

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.440
footage that you own, the assets you own

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.160
and have so that you can very quickly

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.160
put together stories for fans? And the

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.880
demand for content is just exponentially

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.880
growing and fans want to see something

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.720
that's more personalized to them. And

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.800
that means you have to find a way to be

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.800
able to scale the way you access your

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.120
own footage library and to be able to

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.399
piece these stories together uh so that

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.800
you can distribute them in more

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:42.399
personalized manner. And so in the case

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.560
of Maple Leaf Sports, they actually did

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:46.320
something incredibly cool, which is take

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.920
video understanding technology and build

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.000
an agentic workflow that can do

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.760
prompt-based highlight creation. So, if

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.720
I wanted to create a highlight uh around

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.959
Vince Vince Carter's 30th anniversary, I

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.720
could actually, as a creative um in a

00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:00.720
meeting room with all of our marketing

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.560
team, I could actually just type in a

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.360
prompt or describe things that I have

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.040
ideas of in my head. And instead of

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.200
everyone leaving the meeting and coming

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.360
back a week later, uh we could actually

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.680
visually see what those highlights look

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.640
like in real time as we're talking about

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.040
it. And so the time it takes to create

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.279
highlights um and sports content would

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.120
take could take up from 16 hours to

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:25.440
days. And now you're cutting that down

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.440
to 9 minutes. And that's not just an

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.760
efficiency. It's about how do we do more

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.160
as an organization. Um, and it's an

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.320
incredibly innovative uh use case where

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.279
we saw last year one of the first use

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.279
cases of true uh agent workflows built

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:40.800
on top of video understanding that

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:42.399
actually allows you to scale as an

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.480
organization and to grow the way that

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:46.959
you tell stories. And it's something

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.640
that we're seeing increasingly more of

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:51.680
uh from not just sports organizations

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.399
but from every could be content creators

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.200
um more established legacy media and

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:59.760
studios as well.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.959
Um, I'm gonna walk through on time, but

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.959
here's a quick

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.519
example of

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.519
said technology.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.899
[Music]

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:26.399
[Music]

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:28.240
And so when you describe things that

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.680
you're trying to look for uh whoever

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.959
whether you're in a part of organization

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.839
or partner,

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:37.079
>> you'd be able to find that exact second

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:37.079
or moment.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.440
And in this case now we're taking the

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.040
memory that the AI has created and we're

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.560
creating we're reasoning on top of it.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.560
We're asking create hashtags,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.240
descriptions. You can go as far as to

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.959
say let's create highlights and chapters

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:15.720
for me um and ask very specific

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:15.720
questions uh about the footage you have.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:26.959
Yeah, I'm going to skip over the rest.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:29.440
Um, yeah, and different we 12 apps is a

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:31.680
horizontal platform, meaning the video

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.600
uh as a foundation model. The AI can

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.839
comprehend any type of footage, whether

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.839
it's animation, could be sports, uh

00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:39.360
could be your dash cam footage. Um, in

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:40.880
this case, I'm I'm going to just wrap up

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.800
the case study on Maple Leaf Sports

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.639
Entertainment and why it's so exciting.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.160
One is, of course, time savings and

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:47.600
efficiency. How do you take the best

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.120
talent you have, the creative talent you

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.560
have, and be able to say, you know, save

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.399
their time and be able to do things more

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.160
efficiently? Um, but the more exciting

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:55.519
thing is how do you do more of that? And

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.760
so, how do you build an engine that

00:13:55.519 --> 00:14:00.800
optimizes itself? Um, how do you build

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.440
an creative engine um you know that you

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.519
can actually scale uh engagement uh

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.680
through with fans? And third is of

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:09.760
course personalization. Um how do you

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.160
res create things that really resonate

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.560
with specific audiences? Um, and it's

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.519
the it's really the content machine, the

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.360
engine that helps you do that. Um, so

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:21.920
yeah, that was a little bit about video

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:27.079
understanding. Um, and 12 laps. Hope

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.079
that was interesting. Thank you.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:35.959
>> Now joining So Young on stage, please

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.959
welcome back moderator Zoya Hassan.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.480
concrete

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.720
>> back.

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:48.160
>> Thank you so much for that presentation.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.360
You must be tired of all the talking.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.199
Please drink your water. Um it's really

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.320
fascinating stuff, you know, especially

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:58.079
like as someone non-technical at all

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.680
like it's really just fascinating all

00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:04.160
the things you can do with AI that I

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.920
couldn't ever imagine. But I want to,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.959
you know, humanize the technology a

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.240
little bit more and uh talk more about

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:15.279
12 Labs and your story. So, can you tell

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:19.279
me a little bit about when you guys were

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:21.440
founding this company between 24 and 26

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:22.800
years old, all you co-founders, I want

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.480
to hear I want to hear a little bit

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.360
about the founding days and what it took

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.959
for you guys to get to where you are,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.199
the nitty-gritty details.

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:34.160
>> Yeah, absolutely. So, uh we have five

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:35.519
co-founders. Uh I'm on the business

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.240
development and the go to market side,

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:40.560
but my co-founders actually uh met

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.880
working together um as researchers and

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.279
scientists building AI to be able to

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.519
understand vast amounts of data from

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:48.800
language, image. They couldn't quite

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:50.720
tackle video because there was no

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.920
technology for video understanding at

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.839
the time. So that's really where the

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:58.240
idea came from. Um I met our CEO and

00:15:55.839 --> 00:16:00.880
co-ound my co-founder and CEO Jay in

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.959
high school. So, uh, we met in the ninth

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.920
grade in boarding school. Um, and we

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:08.079
bonded. And so, before we started, we

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.519
started like I think all of us have been

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:12.800
doing this for more than half of our

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:14.560
adult lives now. But, um, we were

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.880
incredibly good friends. We trusted each

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.959
other uh, both in terms of what they

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.720
could do, the potential, but also, um,

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:23.279
as humans, um, as well.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:26.160
>> Yeah. Are you guys still good friends?

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:26.800
>> We're all good friends. I'm glad to hear

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.120
that. Yeah.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.079
>> Uh 12 Labs has raised over hund00

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.240
million. Was that challenging at all?

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:36.560
Especially in the early rounds.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.120
>> Yeah. So as a startup when we had first

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.399
started uh it was think 2020 we started

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.199
building the tech. We officially

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:46.959
incorporated in 2021 and when we had

00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:48.720
started uh LLMs were super nent at the

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:52.000
time too. I don't think I don't know if

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.079
GPT3 was out yet. Uh and so the concept

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.639
of hey we want to build general purpose

00:16:54.079 --> 00:17:00.079
foundation models. They are multimodal

00:16:56.639 --> 00:17:03.360
and multimodal means AI can understand

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:06.240
sound, visual and video. Uh, and we want

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.400
to build APIs that allows any developer

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.959
or enterprise to access capabilities of

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.559
these models sounded ridiculous to

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:16.559
investors. Um, and so I remember like we

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:18.640
weren't even talking to investors at the

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:20.319
time because we had a very strong

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.039
conviction of what we wanted to do and

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:24.799
why, which was we just want to build um,

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:26.799
models that, you know, anyone can build

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:27.919
on top of. And this was meant to be

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:29.360
general purpose, but that's not

00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:30.799
typically not the advice that startup

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.200
founders get. Startup founders get the

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:34.640
advice of, hey, find a very narrow

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.400
problem, build an application,

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.840
completely verticalize first and then

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:42.000
expand. Um, but AI is very different

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.240
today. AI has you know hor to build

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.799
infrastructural technology uh a lot of

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.600
it has to be uh horizontal

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:52.960
>> and so our first ever investor uh was

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.679
index ventures actually um and the way

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.440
they we got their attention was our CTO

00:17:55.679 --> 00:18:00.799
at the time was getting a lot of Aiden

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:04.559
was he's forbes 30 under 30 by the way I

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:06.480
didn't qualify anymore but um so Aiden

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:09.039
uh we got a lot of questions around hey

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.120
you you guys are like these young uh

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:14.320
founders

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.720
in their 20s and you're like 12 people

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.520
who were 12 people at the time 12 people

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:23.120
uh cool stuff but I'm sure every other

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:25.280
hyperscaler Microsoft etc are trying to

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.799
do do exactly what you're trying to do

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.200
and they have unlimited resources and so

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:34.960
at the time our CTO wanted to prove

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.120
something right so we had uh 50k in

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.160
compute credits from AWS that they give

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.480
to startup founders and so He uh made

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.080
made a really big bet and it was a

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.559
gamble for us at the time. We had no

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.799
funding. So he took 50k in startup

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:51.280
credit. Spent it all on training the

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:54.160
baby baby version of what our models are

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.440
today. and uh that was Moringo at the

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.480
time and uh built uh AI that could

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.480
search retrieve uh from video and he

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.880
entered the ICCB value challenge which

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.679
is one of the most prestigious uh

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.400
conferences and competitions in the AI

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:11.919
like video space uh hosted by Microsoft.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.000
They're essentially competing against

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:16.400
Microsoft state-of-the-art art model and

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.320
won first place and that's how uh our

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.760
first investors who had a strong thesis

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.080
around the future of multimodal

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.000
technology uh that's how we first got

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.240
connected and then we also got to meet

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.640
Dr. or fee and she was als she also

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.080
became an investor and um adviser to the

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.400
company and yeah

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.720
>> incredible. What about landing your

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.240
first customer?

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.799
How did you pitch them?

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.559
>> Yeah, so

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:42.480
um

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:44.160
video is

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.520
really

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.600
if you think about it it's ubiquitous.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.760
It's in every industry. And so if you're

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.160
trying to land your first customer, uh

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.679
it means that's exciting, but it's also

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.160
really challenging because it means

00:19:53.679 --> 00:20:00.799
anyone could be your customer. So we

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:03.280
knocked on many many doors. Um,

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:06.640
and I can't mention this by name, but

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:09.520
uh, one of our very first customer, uh,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.160
we actually had we went to a conference

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:15.039
just to meet him and grab him as he was

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.200
walking off the stage from a panel and

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:18.880
he was managing all of the content for

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.120
one of the largest sports leagues in the

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.240
world.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.720
He was actually presenting

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:27.840
coincidentally about the challenge of

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:30.240
tagging, managing tags and having this

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.120
huge organization be able to tap into

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.280
all of the archives uh of video assets

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.320
they have and how inefficient or

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.480
challenging that was. And uh we had like

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.760
all of their like we found videos from

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.760
their organization on YouTube. We made a

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.320
customized demo for him. as he was

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:52.720
coming off of stage, we grabbed him, de

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.799
did a demo for him on our iPad. Um, and

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.280
he we were super lucky. We did many of

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:58.559
these types of things. But when you find

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.200
the right person at the right

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:03.280
organization with the right problem, um,

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.640
they will understand that you're really

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.880
early as a company and as a product. And

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.320
actually, we signed our first PC with

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:15.200
him for $5,000. And really the $5,000

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.280
was to, you know, it's to make sure we

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.200
can actually go through a legal process.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.320
Um, but what we were doing was we were

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.240
learning and uh we learned so much from

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.760
him around the processes of media

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.520
management uh and uh kind of use them as

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.760
a design partner to be able to build our

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.159
product and technology around them. Um

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.440
and kind of we were at the same time

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:37.760
we're exploring all of these other

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.200
potential customers around how do we you

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.080
know is this applicable to other

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.840
prospects and the larger market. Um but

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.200
if you can do that while you're working

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.880
with you know the first few uh customers

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.640
who really believe in you not just

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.000
because what of what you have now but

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.840
because of the future of like what

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.320
you're trying to create. Then it becomes

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.520
an incredible partnership and uh we

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.000
still work with them today and they're

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.640
at different you know organizations now.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.840
Um, but you know, they bring you them

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.440
bring you with them as well.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.200
>> Yeah, absolutely. So, what I heard from

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.360
that guys is that if you would like to

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.360
grab her as she's walking on stage and

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:17.520
picture your product, she's open to it.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.600
um what should this crowd know about

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.039
building an AI

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.039
especially you know what's the

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:27.360
opportunity for small startups to be

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:29.280
really successful when there's such big

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.120
players in the AI world that are

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.360
dominating you know whether that's open

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.600
AI that's enthropic like they dominate

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.280
the scene but startups are obviously

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.679
necessary and that might be

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.720
collaboration and not competition right

00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:44.400
so any thoughts on that uh you have to

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.720
really understand I think your your

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.240
problem space really really well. If you

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.720
think about hyperscalers and how large

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.880
companies work, they have so many

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.880
products and sometimes within even

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.960
within their organizations,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.440
you might have a lot of silos. And for

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.559
startups, the biggest strength that we

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.880
still we have and we we protect and we

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:07.520
grow, we need to grow as we grow as a

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.240
company is how do you minimize and

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.840
shorten the life the communication cycle

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.080
between what you're learning from market

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.159
and how that gets back into product and

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.760
be able to create the flywheel. Uh, and

00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:19.919
if we're talking about AI, that would be

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:24.000
a flywheel between how do you go from

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:27.120
market um to product to data to to

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.320
research and back again. And uh video is

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.679
interesting because video isn't just

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.880
about the model. It's also about

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:32.559
everything that has to do with

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.400
processing video at scale really

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:38.320
efficiently. Um, and so for us that was

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.120
a huge moment that we had, the speed,

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.280
the focus, the prioritization. Um, and

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.000
that's something that uh large companies

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.080
simply cannot do. And if you've raised

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.840
money as founders, then you're spending

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.760
all of that capital on solving this one

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.440
problem. No other organization is going

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:58.480
to spend invest everything they have

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:01.280
into solving that single problem. So, um

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.039
I think it's being able to really

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.679
vocalize like what problem you're

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:07.840
solving really well and just go after

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:09.600
that specific thing. Um because really

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.320
that's that's your that becomes your

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.400
strength.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.200
>> No, that's really great advice. My last

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:18.320
question for you and arguably the most

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:23.320
important one. Why is there an 11 labs

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.320
and a 12 labs? And who came first?

00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:26.320
>> 12 Labs came first.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.240
>> Okay.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.559
>> Almost I think a year. Um but we we work

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.159
we know the 11 Labs folks really well.

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:36.400
Actually a couple years ago there was

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:38.480
like a something that started on

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.960
Twitter. Um same question. We get this

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.960
all the time. And so we did a hackathon

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:47.279
at Shack 15 in SF called 23 Labs. We

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.360
called it the 23 Labs multimodal AI

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:51.039
hackathon. Um we're actually doing

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.799
another one in a couple weeks in New
