00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:08.172
I've always found it curious
how biologists study life.

00:00:09.173 --> 00:00:10.941
There's this saying,

00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:14.278
"A biologist will learn
how a car works by poking at it,

00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.514
removing one part at a time,

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:19.016
and seeing how it affects
the rest of the car.

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:23.354
On the other hand, an engineer
will learn how a car works

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:27.191
by taking it completely apart
and rebuilding it."

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.495
Take, for example,
the Human Genome Project,

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:34.632
one of the biggest breakthroughs
of the last century.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:39.136
We spent over a decade mapping out
all three billion letters of our genome,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.138
the complete set of DNA.

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:46.010
We thought that once we could read DNA
and apply that same principle,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.946
poking and dissecting
one letter at a time,

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.116
that we could start
eradicating all human diseases.

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:58.889
But instead, we began to realize
just how little we actually understood

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.492
about the true function of DNA.

00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:04.895
As a researcher,

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:09.400
I work on artificial intelligence
and trained as an engineer.

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:14.405
I learn by building things
and understand by creating.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.309
Today, I want to share an idea

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:24.081
that can fundamentally change
how we study biology and life itself.

00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:29.854
Instead of just reading and dissecting
DNA, we should be generating it.

00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:35.459
And we can do this
by treating DNA as a language:

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:41.298
one that AI can learn to read,
write and, ultimately, build.

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:47.471
This idea led myself
and a team of researchers

00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:50.274
at Stanford and the Arc Institute

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:52.076
with a sort of moonshot:

00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:58.449
Can we generate an entire genome
from scratch using AI?

00:01:59.383 --> 00:02:01.852
Build life from the ground up?

00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:09.426
Now I understand the thought of feeding
the code of life into a generative AI

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.697
is both thrilling,
and, perhaps, unsettling.

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:18.269
But I came to realize
that if this was possible,

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:21.038
it could unlock some of the most
powerful breakthroughs

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:23.440
in science and medicine.

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:31.115
But I'll be honest, we had no idea
if AI could actually generate DNA.

00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:34.318
In many ways, DNA is like a language.

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:36.520
It has grammar, structure,

00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:41.458
sort of like sentences and paragraphs
that group together to form a story.

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:45.196
And these stories are passed down
through evolution,

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:46.897
generation by generation.

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:53.604
For humans, it’s been hard to comprehend
these stories written in DNA

00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:55.673
in large part because of its scale.

00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:59.410
DNA is extremely long,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.080
and yet, at the same time,
sensitive to the smallest mistakes.

00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:08.786
Imagine trying to write
something the length of 30,000 books

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.487
in a foreign language.

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:16.160
And that when you're off
by a single letter, one of billions,

00:03:16.193 --> 00:03:19.830
this can mean the difference
between a healthy person

00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:22.266
and a person
with a life-threatening disease.

00:03:24.368 --> 00:03:30.040
And so to tackle these challenges,
together with my colleague Michael Poli,

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:35.346
we developed an AI that could generate
extremely long sequences of DNA,

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.549
500 times longer than previous AI models,

00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:40.618
at high levels of detail.

00:03:41.852 --> 00:03:45.889
We assembled a team
of scientists and AI experts

00:03:45.923 --> 00:03:50.194
and gathered the largest collection
of DNA used to train AI,

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:54.999
80,000 whole genomes
fed into a model that we called ...

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.967
Evo.

00:03:58.102 --> 00:04:01.972
And our goal was to create
something like a ChatGPT for DNA,

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:05.209
where you can prompt Evo
and describe the DNA you want,

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.712
and it would generate new sequences,
one letter at a time.

00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:12.850
But there is one key difference.

00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:16.587
With chatbots, you can
just read what it writes,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.123
and you can decide
if it makes sense to you.

00:04:19.123 --> 00:04:21.625
With DNA, it's not so simple.

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:24.662
It's not an intuitive human language.

00:04:24.662 --> 00:04:26.730
How do you know if it's any real or good?

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.599
What does that even mean?

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:32.002
What we needed was a test,

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:35.839
a way to verify that what it wrote
would actually function.

00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:42.479
And so we started with a familiar tool
in biology called CRISPR.

00:04:42.513 --> 00:04:47.051
CRISPR is like a pair of molecular
scissors that can edit DNA,

00:04:47.084 --> 00:04:49.219
used for things like gene therapy.

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:52.289
We asked Evo to make its own,

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:55.859
and generate its own version
of CRISPR from scratch,

00:04:55.893 --> 00:04:58.095
which had never been done before.

00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:01.231
It's got proteins and RNA inside,

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:02.599
it's a complex system.

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:06.704
And so our biologists
would take that generated DNA

00:05:06.737 --> 00:05:10.307
and analyze it to see
how realistic does it look,

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:12.242
does it resemble something in nature?

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:13.977
How do its proteins fold?

00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.914
Which all gave us a sense of its function.

00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:19.216
But ultimately,

00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:23.854
we have to test their ability to cut DNA
by actually building them in the lab.

00:05:24.922 --> 00:05:26.457
And so that's what we did.

00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:33.731
Now waiting for lab results can sometimes
be a nerve-racking experience.

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:37.901
Honestly, it's kind of like waiting
for the results of a pregnancy test.

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.540
You’re excited, anxious
and hopeful for a positive outcome.

00:05:43.974 --> 00:05:45.376
And then, all of a sudden ...

00:05:46.543 --> 00:05:48.479
these two little lines appear.

00:05:49.012 --> 00:05:53.183
Just to be crystal clear,
these two lines are a good thing.

00:05:53.217 --> 00:05:54.485
That's what we want.

00:05:54.485 --> 00:05:57.187
(Laughter)

00:05:57.187 --> 00:06:01.759
It means that our CRISPRs
cut a single strand of DNA into two,

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.196
in the exact right spot,
just like natural CRISPRs in the lab.

00:06:06.864 --> 00:06:08.499
And so that's when we knew ...

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.734
it worked.

00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:13.670
(Laughter)

00:06:13.704 --> 00:06:14.705
(Applause)

00:06:14.738 --> 00:06:15.973
Thank you.

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:17.107
(Applause)

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:21.545
What you're seeing here
is the world's first CRISPR system

00:06:21.578 --> 00:06:24.081
designed entirely by AI.

00:06:24.848 --> 00:06:30.220
Evo generated DNA that not only looked
realistic, but that actually functioned.

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:36.160
And so next, we decided
to go for that moonshot,

00:06:36.193 --> 00:06:39.096
to try and generate
a whole genome from scratch.

00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:42.633
And Evo was able to generate
hundreds of synthetic proteins

00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:46.003
in a genome that resembled
those in nature.

00:06:46.036 --> 00:06:49.306
But ultimately,
it was missing a few parts.

00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:51.208
It wasn't yet complete,

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:53.210
more like a rough sketch of the genome.

00:06:55.012 --> 00:06:57.414
However, this is just the first version.

00:06:57.448 --> 00:07:01.819
That rough sketch of the genome
will become more detailed over time.

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:03.720
In fact, within years,

00:07:03.754 --> 00:07:08.992
we anticipate AI will be able to generate
whole functional genomes.

00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:15.532
In other words, AI will be able
to generate new life.

00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:19.136
As this technology improves,

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.941
biology will shift
from discovery to design.

00:07:25.542 --> 00:07:27.878
What might this world look like?

00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:29.580
Let's look ahead.

00:07:30.647 --> 00:07:34.785
In this future, we can make
truly personalized medicine.

00:07:34.818 --> 00:07:38.755
Imagine prompting an AI like Evo
with your genome,

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:41.191
finding sources of diseases,

00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:44.194
predicting your reaction to drugs,

00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:47.631
and guiding treatment options
based on your own DNA.

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:53.737
But why even take medicine
when you might have a permanent cure?

00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:57.274
We might choose to alter our DNA outright,

00:07:57.274 --> 00:07:59.476
and we are beginning to see this today.

00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:05.349
Recently, the FDA approved the first
gene therapy for sickle cell disease,

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:08.652
a painful, lifelong
condition of the blood.

00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:12.389
And it works by just changing
a single gene in a person's DNA

00:08:12.422 --> 00:08:14.258
to permanently cure the patient.

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:19.830
And now, there are
over 500 DNA-altering treatments

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.298
awaiting approval.

00:08:22.466 --> 00:08:25.602
But let's say you're not comfortable
with changing your DNA.

00:08:26.136 --> 00:08:28.272
What if we added new DNA?

00:08:30.207 --> 00:08:33.677
All of our DNA is organized
into 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:08:34.244 --> 00:08:38.015
Chapters, if you will, in the book
that is our genome.

00:08:38.982 --> 00:08:42.753
What if Evo learned to generate
a 24th chapter?

00:08:42.786 --> 00:08:43.954
A whole new chromosome,

00:08:43.987 --> 00:08:49.192
equipped with all the machinery needed
to fight hundreds of diseases on demand.

00:08:52.029 --> 00:08:55.799
With DNA generation,
what is the limit of what's possible?

00:08:57.367 --> 00:08:58.902
We've all seen "Jurassic Park."

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.005
We all thought it was science fiction.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:03.473
And it is ...

00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:05.242
mostly.

00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:09.680
Researchers are now reconstructing
the genomes of extinct species,

00:09:09.713 --> 00:09:13.350
with one company planning
to resurrect the woolly mammoth

00:09:13.383 --> 00:09:16.053
by as early as 2028.

00:09:16.086 --> 00:09:19.256
Now instead of bringing back
extinct species,

00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:21.325
can we create new ones?

00:09:22.492 --> 00:09:26.463
Researchers are now engineering
microbes for colonizing Mars.

00:09:27.764 --> 00:09:31.368
If we one day wish
to be a multiplanetary species,

00:09:31.368 --> 00:09:35.439
we'd have to figure out how to grow things
on Mars, make it more hospitable,

00:09:35.439 --> 00:09:36.773
and possibly terraform.

00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:38.775
And it is possible.

00:09:38.809 --> 00:09:40.210
We have microbes on Earth

00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:42.879
that can handle a range
of extreme conditions

00:09:42.913 --> 00:09:45.015
that we call extremophiles.

00:09:46.016 --> 00:09:49.653
Now I understand some
of these things might sound scary.

00:09:50.587 --> 00:09:54.224
One of the biggest concerns
is biosecurity,

00:09:54.257 --> 00:09:56.827
the potential to create bioweapons.

00:09:57.995 --> 00:10:01.031
Can AI be used to generate
more infectious viruses?

00:10:01.865 --> 00:10:03.333
Yes.

00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:07.237
But AI can also defend and monitor
against these threats as well.

00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:11.341
And so perhaps you feel like me

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:16.880
in that you have to choose between
advocating for innovation versus safety.

00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:23.887
I'd encourage you to embrace both,
because stopping progress entirely,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.489
I don't think it's practical.

00:10:26.056 --> 00:10:28.925
We need to evolve with the technology,

00:10:28.925 --> 00:10:30.927
monitor its capabilities,

00:10:30.927 --> 00:10:33.563
and constantly be asking ourselves,

00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:36.466
"What possible futures are we enabling?"

00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:42.639
As humans, we've always sought
to understand the world around us.

00:10:43.306 --> 00:10:44.741
That is in our nature.

00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:49.780
But understanding alone
has rarely been enough.

00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:55.318
For centuries, we've studied life
by observing and dissecting it.

00:10:56.219 --> 00:10:59.022
But now, we're no longer
just reading life's code.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.392
We now have the power to generate it.

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:10.033
And with AI, we’re at the beginning
of unlocking new medicines, science

00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:12.903
and even entire new forms of life.

00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:16.740
Do we make small edits?

00:11:17.774 --> 00:11:19.810
Do we write entirely new chapters?

00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:24.281
Or do we one day design life itself?

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.486
Because to truly understand biology,

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.021
we must create it.

00:11:31.755 --> 00:11:35.459
And the future of life,
it's ours to build.

00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:38.195
Thank you.

00:11:38.228 --> 00:11:42.699
(Cheers and applause)
