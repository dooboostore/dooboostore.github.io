00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
- Hello, Vogue.

00:00:00.893 --> 00:00:04.654
I'm Anya Taylor-Joy, and this
is my life in looks so far.

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:07.080
[chill jazzy music]

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.120
I'm curious, I wanna know.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.460
I'm like, "What do you have in here?"

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.140
Oh my God!

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.840
So this is Thomasin in "The Witch."

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.180
This was my first real film role.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.920
I loved that costume so much.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.330
It's a soft corset,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.520
which if you're getting into corsetry,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.170
was a very good way to go.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.270
And what you can't see underneath this

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.580
is that I have one long hair ribbon

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.260
that's tying all of my hair together.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.880
And I fell so in love with this character,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.010
and I didn't realize that
characters were real for me

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.510
because this was my first job.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.800
So when the job finished,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.240
I was really mourning her,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.990
and I kept her hair ribbons
in my bag for a whole year.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.100
And then we did re-shoots,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.896
and they were like, "Ah, we
don't have the hair ribbon."

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:48.630
And I was like, "I got it."

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.120
This is the first time that
I went to the Met Gala.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.400
That is the only time that
I've been to the Met Gala.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.860
I've always been working
when it's happening.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.730
I loved this dress so
much, it was so heavy.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.310
I was really freaked out
because I didn't know anybody.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.820
And I think that
situation in and of itself

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.170
is very like, "Ah!"

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.030
But the dress made me feel great.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.770
And I don't know if you can see,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.000
but I'm wearing a necklace

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.210
that has like a bunch of
little baby heads all over it.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.410
And that was my favorite part.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.900
But at the end of the night, I got to,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.580
I was at the top of the stairs

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.870
and was kind of just trying

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.230
to like honestly figure out
how I was going to get home.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.610
I hadn't thought that far ahead,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.080
and I was like, "Ah, this
is gonna be madness."

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.330
And Hailee Steinfeld walked past me,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.810
and she had all of these like long trains,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.920
and they enveloped me and
almost toppled me to my death.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.780
But then Jimmy Fallon saved me.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.303
So that's a very normal story, I think.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.130
Yeah!

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.570
Oh, these make me so happy.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.850
This is Johnny Flynn and myself,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.850
shot by Autumn de Wilde
for our movie, "Emma."

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.260
Look at my shoes!

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.290
So like the best thing
about all of these costumes

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.180
is they were made on my body

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.310
from like hours and hours of fittings.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.980
And Alexandra Byrne, our costume designer,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.710
who like I want to be when
I grow up, she's so cool,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.360
we got to spend so much time together.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.600
And it felt like such an
integral part of the character.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.360
And the thing with Emma is
she's always performing.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.070
Her wardrobe is very performative.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.620
And so each one of the
looks was like a true look,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.030
from the earrings, to the necklace,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.580
to the shoes, to the reticule.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.190
That's a fun word, reticule.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.590
Yeah, it was great.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.751
I forgot that, yeah.

00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.870
I was nominated for a
Golden Globe for this.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.220
It was a weird time

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.490
because my whole experience of award shows

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.680
all took place over Zoom.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.000
And I got nominated

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.840
for "Emma" and "Queen's Gambit," I think.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.200
And it was just so surreal and exciting

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.970
and, yeah, really thrilling.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.950
2020 was a big, yeah, here we go.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.570
Baby Beth, "Queen's Gambit."

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.760
She is about to get her first period.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.990
It's a big day for her.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.090
This was really fun

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.050
because I got to spend so
much time with this character

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.160
that I loved so much,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.990
and I got to play her

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.660
through so many different
eras of her life.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.240
And I remember having like a real fondness

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.830
for her at this age.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.690
She kind of walks a little dumpy,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.700
she's like a bit unsure of herself.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.410
I had never played chess,

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.080
and it was crazy because
we showed up my first day,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.280
and they gave me like this
bible of all the chess moves

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.420
that we were going to do in the show,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.410
all of the chess games,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.810
and they were all based
off of historical games.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.250
And I like went home,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.470
I was a good student, I
learned a bunch of them.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.160
Our first day was the
Mexico tournament series,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.330
and they changed a move,

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.730
and I was like, "No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.207
"This is how this is gonna work.

00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:39.877
"You're gonna show me the
moves five minutes beforehand,

00:03:39.877 --> 00:03:42.127
"I'm gonna execute it, and
then I'm gonna bin that

00:03:42.127 --> 00:03:43.680
"and throw another one in."

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.790
And it worked.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.220
I love her final white queen look

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.250
because I think that's when
she was feeling herself.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.544
She was like, "Yeah, I'm okay."

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:53.377
[Anya laughs]

00:03:53.377 --> 00:03:54.870
There are so many of the shoes

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.070
that I actually really enjoyed.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.240
I really love a kitten heel.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.470
I got to keep a bunch.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.560
Another wonderful costume
designer, Gabriele Binder,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.100
she was so tender towards me

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.770
because all of my characters
are important to me,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.820
but Beth was somebody

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.690
that I knew from the second I read her,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.310
and I was like, "Oh, okay, this is..."

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.360
She was the first character

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.160
that I had to give a lot of myself to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.870
in order to be able to make her real.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.720
And Gabriele was very cognizant of that

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.880
and really tried all of the clothes on me.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.080
And if my body rejected it,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.310
we would take them away.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.180
So at the end of the show,

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.720
she said, "This is your
wardrobe, so you can keep it."

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.340
The coolest thing about "Queen's Gambit"

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.450
was I'd gone back to work,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.730
I was working on "The
Northman" at the time,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.610
and the only reason that I
realized it was doing well

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.770
was because members of the
crew would come up to me

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.027
and be like, "Hey, I saw your show.

00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:44.130
"You were really great in it."

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.050
And I was like, "Okay."

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.940
And then it was just more
and more and more people.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.320
So it was a gentle experience,
I would say, until it wasn't.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.270
[Anya laughs]
Okay.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.410
Ah, I love this dress so much!

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.770
This is Dior at the Emmy's.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.230
This was a crazy time in my life.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.140
I was shooting "The Menu,"

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.900
doing awardsy stuff for "Queen's Gambit,"

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.440
and promoting "Last Night in
Soho" all at the same time.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.540
And I think we were on
night shoots for "The Menu."

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.174
So it was really like a...

00:05:17.174 --> 00:05:18.300
[Anya drum rolls]

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.460
I had a dream about this dress,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.230
and I wrote to Maria Grazia,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.097
and I was like, "I've just had this image,

00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:25.687
"and I really, you know,

00:05:25.687 --> 00:05:27.210
"would love it if it could come true."

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.890
And she made it come true.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.230
I felt so good in this.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.180
The back was really, really low.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.970
I can't remember what movie
the reference was from,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.670
but I was wearing Tiffany
diamonds on the back.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.663
And I felt good.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.460
2021, another, ah, I love a cape.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.630
I love these silhouettes.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.800
Look at the shoe.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.940
This is also Dior.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.410
This was Golden Globes.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.850
Again, it was still COVID,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.270
so there was no award ceremony in person.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.980
It was all on a computer.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.590
And my friends had flown over

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.537
and asked me how I wanted to celebrate.

00:06:00.537 --> 00:06:03.030
And I said I really
wanted vegan fried chicken

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.270
and I wanted to have a sleepover.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.290
And then I won,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.120
and then we did that and it was great.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.263
Okay.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.850
This is Sandie wearing similar boots

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.410
from "Last Night in Soho."

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.300
This was very late at night.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.960
We basically became nocturnal for months,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.510
and it was hilarious because
we were shooting in real Soho,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.510
and I would see my friends
that were out partying,

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.789
and they were like, "Why
do you look like that?"

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.252
And I was like, "I am working."

00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:32.085
[Anya laughs]

00:06:32.085 --> 00:06:35.250
I knew she sang, but I think
I was a bit anxious about it,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.930
and the way that I deal with my anxiety

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.770
is by putting it off,

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.470
which is like probably not the
intelligent way of doing it.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.850
And so it just came to the day,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.510
and I was like, "Ah, okay,
I'm gonna do my best."

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.400
The dancing, we did have rehearsals,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.570
and that was so much fun.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.430
Like me and Matt Smith dancing together

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.948
for hours on end, it was fab.

00:06:51.948 --> 00:06:52.830
2022.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.180
What year are we in now?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.340
This is "The Menu" premiere.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.297
I'm wearing Alexander McQueen.

00:06:58.297 --> 00:07:02.940
"The Menu" is a satirical horror movie

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.260
in which a group of guests

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.750
arrive at a Michelin star restaurant

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.430
where the chef has other ideas

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.650
about what is on the menu that evening.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.780
Did that make any sense?
[Anya laughs]

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.890
Okay.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.770
2024, I am wearing Dior

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.380
at the "Dune: Part Two"
premiere in London.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.890
It was the hardest secret I
think I've ever had to keep.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.160
But I'll really, you know, give
props to Denis on this one.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.510
He is the most wonderful human
being and talented creator,

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.690
and he had so much faith and hope

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.090
that we were gonna keep
this secret for the fans

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.240
that it just really made
you wanna go, "Shh."

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.650
So I told my mom and I told my husband.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.735
That was it.

00:07:44.735 --> 00:07:45.568
It was just so exciting.

00:07:45.568 --> 00:07:47.370
All the cast were so kind to me.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.480
It was fabulous.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.520
What a great way to be like,
"Welcome to the family."

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.690
I'm like dressed like an egg.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.566
Like, "Hi, how's it going?"
[Anya laughs]

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:57.399
Hee-hee!

00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:01.860
This is the "Furiosa" premiere
in Australia, in Sydney.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.080
This is archival Paco Rabanne.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.230
And it, ugh, it was so good.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.390
I couldn't sit down, but that was fine.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.710
I will like give that
up any day to wear this.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.360
That headpiece was incredible.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.470
It was very heavy.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.620
I definitely had like
insane divots in my head.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.340
Fun fact, I tend to surf
to most of my premieres.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.270
We get a sprinter van,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.750
and I am standing up in
the middle of the aisles,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.810
and I've now like turned that
into a fun game for myself.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.670
I would like to like
not hold onto anything

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.530
and just exclusively surf.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.730
I also don't really work out,

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.880
so that's like a really
good thigh exercise,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.680
and it gives me a place to put my anxiety.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.763
So, yeah, I surf.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.760
This is arriving in Cannes.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.420
I am wearing Atlein, and
the hat is Jacquemus.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.760
I'm not usually very well organized.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.950
I'm very good at onset environments.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.180
My brain works in that way.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.850
But, for myself, I'm like
quite a messy individual.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.860
And for this, I just got like,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.870
I don't know, a message from beyond

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.240
that was like, "You should change now."

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.830
So I wore something
different on the plane,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.010
and then I went into the
bathroom and came out,

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.970
and everyone was like,
"Okay, like, let's go."

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.800
Very glad I did wear that hat though.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.770
There was a lot of people outside,

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.010
and it was kind of like
a good buffer actually.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.750
I'm a sucker for headpieces.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.460
I really love the '20's,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.960
and I love old Hollywood as well.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.670
And I just feel like there's something

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.200
about the theatricality of it

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.780
that makes me feel more in
my body in these situations.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.720
I feel like if I can
make something into art,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.970
then I have an easier time with it.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.490
So, yeah, headpieces, they help.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.870
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha, yeah.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.030
This is the Golden Globes.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.860
I am wearing archival Dior.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.180
I felt so good.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.470
I felt so comfortable.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.640
There's something about this
specific silk, it's like heavy.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.900
If I was a fabric,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.120
I would like to believe
that I am this fabric.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.430
I feel like I could wear it forever.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.620
I still get so excited

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.080
that I get to watch all of
these movies before they're out.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.330
I feel like that's my
version of like making it,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.160
that and reading books
that aren't published.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.780
I just feel thrilled.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.720
So, yeah, I definitely do a
lot of watching over Christmas.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.200
This necklace has an
absurd amount of carats.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.610
I feel like I'm told about it,

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.500
and then I try my best to forget

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.333
because then I'm like,

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:18.240
"Take it back, take it
back, take it back."

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.360
I didn't realize that
people didn't wear opals.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.490
I just thought they were beautiful.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.350
And I like the fact that they changed

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.550
depending on the light.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.620
Also, a friend of mine like sent me,

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.020
I'm not on TikTok, TikTok is bad for me,

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.390
but a friend of mine sent me a TikTok

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.220
that basically talked about

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.410
like how I don't give a
fuck about a color wave

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.050
or like a color analysis thing.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:40.950
And looking at this like,

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.060
yeah, I would agree with you.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.320
I don't think I give a fuck
about the color analysis.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.820
[Anya laughs]

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.860
This was the most fun day.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.050
It was very cold, but we did not care.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.670
I have a really wonderful relationship

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.500
with Seb, the photographer.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.240
He knows me and my husband really well,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.830
and so it just felt easy.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.540
I had a really good soundtrack on,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.850
and, yeah, it was a really beautiful day.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.770
My grandmother is a religious reader,

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.530
and she lives in Zaragoza,
it's from Barcelona,

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.593
and so it's just really,
really, like I feel proud.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.910
[chill jazzy music]

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.490
Thank you for watching.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.483
Love to you all.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.870
This was really fun.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.010
And, yeah, I'm excited to
see where this goes next.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.010
[chill jazzy music]

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:37.259
