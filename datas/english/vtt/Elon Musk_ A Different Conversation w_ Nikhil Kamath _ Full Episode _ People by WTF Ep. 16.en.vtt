WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Heat. Heat.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.119
Our

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.719
audience is largely wannabe

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.120
entrepreneurs in India. And I feel like

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.399
all of us have so much to learn from you

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.239
because you've done it so many times

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.719
over in so many different domains.

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.280
>> Yeah.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.399
>> Uh so we will speak to them today and I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.000
will try and center all my questions in

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.760
that direction so they can take

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.680
advantage of this conversation and maybe

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.680
start take a chance and build something.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.520
You want a coffee?

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.240
>> Um, sure. Why not?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.600
>> Okay.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.799
>> Okay. Are we going to be talking for a

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.000
while?

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.119
>> I hope we are.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.600
>> Okay. Good. Sure.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.159
Um,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.520
>> Mna,

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.200
>> may I trouble you for a coffee?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.880
>> Can we get another coffee?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.840
>> Anything? Uh, cappuccino, I guess. All

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.360
right.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.439
>> Are you a coffee drinker, El? Oh,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.640
>> yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I copy once

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.759
usually in the mornings, you know.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.040
>> Okay.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.439
>> One a day kind of thing.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.439
>> Yeah, pretty much.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.920
>> You want to wait for it?

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.920
>> No, I'm I'm I'm good.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.160
The first thing I must say is you're a

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.959
lot bigger and bulkier, muscular than I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.200
would have thought you are.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.440
>> Oh.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.080
>> Oh, stop. You must make me blush.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.680
>> Really? Seriously?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.080
>> Yeah. I mean, look on the internet. I'm

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.080
small, you know.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.599
>> Yeah. Essentially,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.680
what percentage of internet

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.280
>> Yeah. is spend on Twitter. Is there a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.879
number to it on X?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.879
>> Well, so we have like about 600 million

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.599
monthly users.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.280
>> Um well, although it it can spike up if

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.680
there's if there's some major event in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.080
the world, it can get up to I don't know

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.840
800 million or or or a billion.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.720
>> Um if there's some major event in the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:02.239
world. So, uh so so that there's I don't

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.440
know 250 300 million per week type of

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.800
thing. It's a pretty decent number. It

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.040
tends to be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.519
>> um readers, you know, people that read

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.879
words.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.200
>> Um you know, so

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.440
>> do you think that'll change? Um yeah, I

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.519
mean there's

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.800
uh there's certainly a lot of video on

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.080
on um on the X systems, but uh at this

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.640
point increasing amounts of video, but I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.319
think where where uh the X network is

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.640
strongest is among people who who think

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.000
who think a lot and read a lot, you

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.760
know. So it's that's where it's going to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.480
be strongest because we have words

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.080
and and you know so um am among readers

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.159
writers and thinkers I think X is number

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.519
one in the world

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.120
>> as far as social media goes the form

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.680
factor

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.879
if you had to wager a guess for tomorrow

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.680
>> how much is text how much is video

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.680
I've heard you speak about maybe voice

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.760
and hearing being the next form of

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.760
communication with AI, what happens to X

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.040
in its true form? How does it evolve?

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.720
>> Yeah. So, I I do think most interaction

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.240
is going to be video in the future. Uh

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.639
most interaction is going to be uh

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.320
real-time video with AI. So, real-time

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.120
video comprehension, real-time video

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.800
generation. Um that's going to be most

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.199
of the load. And that's how it is for

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.600
most of the internet right now. It's um

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.240
most of the internet is video. Um text

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.520
is a pretty small percentage but the the

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.560
text tends to be higher value generally

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.320
or more it's more densely compressed

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.479
information like um

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.840
yeah so

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.759
but if you say like what is the most

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.919
amount of bits generated and compute

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.840
spent it's certainly going to be video

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.880
>> so I used to be a shareholder of X a

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.560
very small one okay

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.720
>> and I got paid when you bought it when

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.479
you bought Twitter and you made it

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.800
U

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.840
happy decision. Glad you did it.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.720
>> Yeah. Yeah. I think it was important. Um

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.639
you know, I felt like uh Twitter was

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.720
heading in or had had gone in a

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.280
direction that had sort of a more of a

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.759
negative influence on the world. Um you

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.440
know, it was it was I mean, of course,

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.039
this depends on one's perspective. Some

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.639
people will say, well, actually, they

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.639
liked the way it was and now they don't

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:36.639
like it. Um but the I think the

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:39.840
fundamental thing was that um Twitter

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.759
was amplifying

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.280
I would say a fairly pretty far left by

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.039
most people's standards in the world's

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.160
ideology because of where it was based

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.600
in San Francisco. So and and they

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.960
actually suspended a lot of people on

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.600
the right. Uh um so

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.680
uh so from their perspective even

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.120
someone in the center would be would be

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.800
far right. If you're if you're far left

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.360
anyone in the center is far right

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.919
because you're you it's just a political

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.520
on the political spectrum they're um

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.199
they're just as far left as you get in

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.280
the United States and in San Francisco.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.240
So what I've tried to do is just restore

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.319
it to be balanced and and uh centrist.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.880
So there haven't been any left-wing

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:22.240
voices that have been suspended or you

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.759
know banned or uh deamplified or

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.680
anything like that. Now some of them

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:30.240
have chosen to just go go somewhere

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.039
else. Um but uh but at this point it is

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.800
the the the operating principle of the

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:39.039
of the X system is to adhere to any

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.880
country's laws but not to put our thumb

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.880
on the scale beyond the laws of a

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.880
country.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.560
When I think of social media, um,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.560
>> thank you. When I think of social media,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.360
Elon,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.199
I feel like even data suggests that the

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.039
current incumbents seem to be losing

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.840
traction amongst the youngest of

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:02.319
audience.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.280
>> Yeah.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.880
>> Even platforms like Instagram, uh, I

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.440
mean, they're not exactly like Twitter,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.840
but platforms across the board. If one

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.400
had to rework social media and build

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.520
something bottom up, what do you think

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.520
could work for the world of tomorrow?

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.039
>> Well, I mean, I I don't think that much

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.840
about

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.680
um about social media to be frank. I

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.479
mean, it's I can mostly just want to

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.560
have have something where there's um a

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:35.919
in the case of of X, kind of a global

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.560
town square,

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:41.039
>> uh where where people can say what they

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.240
want to say uh with words, pictures,

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:46.720
video um where there's a secure

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.720
messaging system. We've recently added

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:53.840
the ability to to do audio and video

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.440
calls. Um, so you're really trying to

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.639
bring the the the world the world

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.639
together into um a a collective

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:05.280
consciousness and um

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:08.240
that that's I guess different from just

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.800
saying like what is the most dopamine

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.759
generating video stream that one could

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.440
make? Um which uh you know you I think

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:20.080
can be a little bit of brain rot

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.840
frankly. um you know, if if you're just

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.879
watching videos that just cause dopamine

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.599
hits one after another, um but lack

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:29.680
substance, then I think those those are

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:33.599
not great that that's not a great way to

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.360
spend time. Um but I I do think that's

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:37.839
actually what a lot of people are going

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.959
to want to watch. Um, so if you say like

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:44.560
total internet usage, it's going to

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:47.120
probably be optimizing for, you know,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.040
neur neurotransmitter generation, like

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.000
it it there's somebody getting like a a

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.399
kick out of it,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.320
>> right?

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:54.399
>> But it's it's it's it becomes like a

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.959
drug type of thing. So,

00:08:54.399 --> 00:09:01.360
>> um, but I'm not really after

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:03.920
my goal is not to do that. I I guess I

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.959
could do that if I if I wanted to, but

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.760
um uh that's I I just want to really

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:11.839
have um a a global platform that brings

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.519
together

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.800
like like I said like it's come becomes

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:16.399
as close to sort of a collective

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.600
consciousness

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:22.800
uh of humanity as possible. Um and um

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.480
you know like and one of the things that

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:30.640
we've introduced uh for example is

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.240
automatic translation. So um so because

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.360
I think it would be great to bring

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:38.320
together uh what what people say in many

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.160
different languages um and but

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.399
automatically translated for the

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.040
recipient. So you have the collective

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:46.480
consciousness not not just of of say

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.480
people in a particular language group

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.920
but you have

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:54.480
um the thoughts of of people in you know

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.040
every language group. And why is that

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.880
important collective consciousness to

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.080
have one platform?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:06.519
>> I I guess uh

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.519
yeah why is that important? Um

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:18.160
I I guess it's you could also say like

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.000
like why uh

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.279
you know if you consider humans like

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.360
humans are composed of around 30 to 40

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:27.120
trillion cells

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.040
um

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.399
and

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:35.240
you know there's trillions of synap

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:35.240
synapses in your in your mind Um

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:43.600
but but but there's there's no the why a

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:45.680
bit. I mean I guess it's just so we can

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.240
increase

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.560
our understanding our our understand

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.560
increase our

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:58.680
understanding of the the universe. Um,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.680
so

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.040
I I guess I like I had this sort of

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.680
question about what's the meaning of

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:14.000
life, you know, um like why

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:18.959
why is anything important? Um

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.959
um you know why why why are we here? Um

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:24.640
what's the origin of the universe? Where

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:25.920
what is the end? Um

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.079
What are the questions that we don't

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:31.920
even know to ask? Um,

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:34.720
and probably the questions we don't even

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.279
know to ask are the most important ones.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.079
Um, so I'm just trying to I guess

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:43.360
understand what's going on. What is what

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:48.959
is going on in this reality? Um,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:50.399
is is this is this reality? And um

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:53.360
>> um

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:56.320
>> and where did you get when you asked

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.760
what is the point of life?

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:02.800
>> Yeah. So I

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:06.000
I came to the conclusion that um which

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.079
is somewhat in the Douglas Adams

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.120
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy school

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:10.480
of thought which is

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.399
>> what he do.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.680
>> Yeah. He you know he sort of Hug's Guide

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:18.079
to the Galaxy is like a book on

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.480
philosophy disguised as humor.

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:20.079
>> Yeah.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.440
>> And

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:26.639
the that's where you know Earth turns

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.240
out to be this computer to understand to

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:29.360
get to figure out the answer of the

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.839
meaning of life

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.839
>> and it comes up with the answer 42

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:37.040
>> and but then it's like what the heck

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:39.920
does 42 mean? Um, and it turns out,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.880
well, actually the hard part is

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.240
the question, not the answer. And for

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.320
that, you need a much bigger computer

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.079
than Earth. That's so basically what

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.200
Douglas Adams was saying is that we we

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:52.800
actually don't know how to frame the

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.480
questions properly. Um, and um, and so,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.120
so I think by expanding the scope and

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.000
scale of consciousness, we can better

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.880
under understand what questions to ask

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.120
about the answer that is the universe.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:09.320
Do you believe the collective

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.320
consciousness of society?

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.279
You know when when I I was watching this

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:14.720
movie recently called the gladiator

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:16.320
Russell Crowe. Have you seen it?

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.720
>> Yeah.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.360
>> In Gladiator in Rome when people are

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.600
fighting

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.279
>> Yeah.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.839
>> and the crowd is cheering when people

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:27.760
kill each other.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:29.760
>> Uh

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:33.279
the collective is very much like the

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:36.320
mob. It doesn't have

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:38.480
nuance in its opinion per se.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.560
>> Well, I that's a particular kind of mob.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.160
I mean, the sort of going there to see

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.760
people kill each other, you know.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.519
>> Do you suspect the society we live in

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.760
today is very different?

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:50.079
>> Well, we don't we don't generally uh at

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.680
this point we don't,

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.880
you know, go watch people kill each

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.480
other. Uh

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.360
>> maybe

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.920
some kind of euphemism of that

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:03.440
>> sports, I suppose.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.920
Uh so people do sports without um

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.760
where teams attempt to defeat each other

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.079
>> but minus the death

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.480
>> right.

00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:12.880
>> Um so

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.839
just going back to the

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:19.600
uh consideration of a human we all

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:21.760
started out as one cell but now we are

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.000
over 30 trillion cells. Mhm.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.720
>> Um

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.480
and uh

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.600
but I think most people like feel like

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.120
they're one one body like you know

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.920
usually your right hand's not fighting

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:41.360
your left hand type of thing you know

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:43.199
>> to to sort of cooperate. Um your mind is

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.440
uh

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:46.440
you know

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.480
just a vast number of neurons but but

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:53.120
most of the time it doesn't feel like

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.680
there's you know a trillion voices in

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.279
your brain. Hopefully not.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.480
Um

00:14:57.279 --> 00:15:04.959
so so there there's there's clearly

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:07.440
more that happens when you have

00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:11.680
trillions of cells uh working as a

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:14.880
cellular collective than say one cell or

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:17.040
um a a small you know small

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.360
multisellular creature. There's there's

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.639
clearly some something different that

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.680
happens like you can't talk to a

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:22.079
bacteria you know.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.920
>> Yeah.

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:27.680
>> It's very silent.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.880
um they just sort of wiggle around and

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.639
you know from their perspective I don't

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.320
know I sort of what is what is life like

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:35.199
from the perspective of a sing of of an

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.800
amoeba you know um but I know you can't

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:37.680
talk to amoeba like they don't talk

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.680
whack

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.560
>> um but you can talk to humans

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.800
>> so there's just something obviously

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:49.199
qualitatively fundamentally different um

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:53.279
for humans once you have a large number

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:55.839
of cells and you know sufficiently large

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:57.680
brain type of thing. There's you can now

00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:59.680
talk to humans

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.519
>> and they they and they can say things,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.800
they can produce things. Um but uh

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:07.759
bacteria are not going to produce a

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.279
spaceship for example. Um but humans

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:11.600
can.

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:13.199
So I think there's something

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.880
qualitatively different that also

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:16.320
happens when there's a collection of

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.839
humans. In fact, in fact, it's safe to

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.600
say that a single human cannot make a

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:22.079
spaceship. I could not make a spaceship

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:25.600
by myself. But but uh with a collection

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:27.120
of humans uh we can make spaceships. So

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.519
there's there's something obviously

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.079
qualitatively different

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:34.320
um about

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:36.079
a collection of humans. In fact, it

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.800
would be impossible for me to learn all

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:40.560
of the areas of expertise. There

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.040
wouldn't be enough time in one lifetime

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.560
to even learn all the things before I

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.360
was dead.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.199
>> So um so you really fundamentally have

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.560
to have a collection of humans to make a

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:52.160
rocket.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.040
Um

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.680
then I think there probably some other

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.920
scaling

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:03.360
qualitative scaling things that happen

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.280
when you have groups of humans and then

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.559
if the

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.280
quality of the interaction or the

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:13.839
quality of the information flow

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:17.520
um is the the better it is the more the

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:20.400
human collective will achieve.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.000
Um, and I'm I like said I'm just curious

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.480
about the nature of the universe and and

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.160
I think if we it's safe to say like if

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.320
if we increase the scope and scale of

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.400
consciousness, we're much more likely to

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.080
understand the nature of the universe

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.320
than if we reduce it.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.039
>> Is that a bit like spirituality? A lot

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.840
of people talk to me about spirituality,

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:43.200
>> right?

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.039
>> I still don't know what it actually

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.000
means. Like I keep asking them, what do

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:48.000
you mean?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
What do you mean?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.120
>> Uh yeah, I mean a lot of people have

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.520
spiritual feelings,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.440
>> right?

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.200
>> Um and um and I wouldn't try to deny

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:02.559
that those spiritual spiritual feelings

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:04.080
are real to them. Um but it's it's uh

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:05.039
it doesn't entirely translate. I can't

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.559
just because somebody else has a

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:11.520
spiritual feeling doesn't mean that I

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:13.919
would have that spiritual feeling. Um so

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.240
um you know I I tend to be kind of

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:18.240
physics pulled which is like if

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.919
something has predictive value

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.440
>> then

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:23.679
I you know I'll pay more attention to it

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.240
than if it doesn't have predictive value

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:27.200
>> right

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.559
>> u so

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.600
you know physics I would say is the

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:33.760
study of that which has predictive value

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.080
uh I think it's pretty good definition

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.640
um so

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.320
>> my primary job elon is a stock broker

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.919
and stock investor Okay.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.000
>> There is no predictive value. Nobody

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:43.919
knows what will happen tomorrow.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.280
>> Well, but I think you can generally say,

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:50.960
you know, um that

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.679
um if if if it's long-term for a

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.400
company,

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:56.559
>> then you can say like, well, does that

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.640
is that do you like the products or

00:18:56.559 --> 00:19:00.480
services of that company? And is it

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.400
likely to

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.360
>> do you like the the product roadmap?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.360
like it seems like they they make great

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.880
products and they're likely to make

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.120
great products in the future. If that's

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.360
the case, then I would say that's

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.000
probably a good company to invest in.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.840
Um, and I think you also want to believe

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.240
in the the team. So, if you think, well,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.400
that's a talented and hardworking team.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.320
They make good products today. They seem

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.000
to be still motivated to make things in

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.840
the future, then I'd say that's that's a

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.960
good company to invest in.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.880
>> Um, fair point.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:35.039
>> Yeah. And now that that that that

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.280
won't solve for the daily fluctuations

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:40.960
which happen and sometimes are pretty

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.679
extreme. Uh but over time it would that

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.919
that is the the right way to invest in

00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:47.600
stocks because a company is just a group

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:49.840
of people assembled to create products

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.679
and services. So you have to say what

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.000
are how good are those products and

00:19:51.679 --> 00:19:56.080
services? Are they likely to continue to

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.360
improve in the future? If so, then you

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.960
should buy the stock of that company and

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.320
and then don't worry too much about the

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.640
daily fluctuations,

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:06.400
>> right?

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.840
What's got you most excited now, Elon,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.600
in terms of all that you're building?

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.000
You're doing so much. So, let me just

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.520
preface and contextualize

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.960
who is watching this. Uh, our audience

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.600
is largely wannabe entrepreneurs in

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.559
India.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.760
>> Okay.

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:25.280
uh really ambitious, really hungry, want

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.080
to

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.400
take the risk and build something and I

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.919
feel like all of us have so much to

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.360
learn from you because you've done it so

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:34.080
many times over in so many different

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.559
domains.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.120
>> Yeah.

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:40.240
>> Uh so we will speak to them today and I

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.840
will try and center all my questions in

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.600
that direction so they can take

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.679
advantage of this conversation and maybe

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:51.799
start take a chance and build something.

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:51.799
>> Okay. Sure. Um

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.640
yeah, I guess the most important thing

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.640
to do is just

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.240
make useful products and services. Um

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.159
>> yeah. Um

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.000
>> which one of all that all the products

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:12.200
and services that you're building has

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.200
got you most excited today?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.799
Well, I I think that there's

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:20.799
increasingly a a convergence actually

00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:24.960
between SpaceX and Tesla and XAI

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:26.880
um in that if the future is um solar

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:31.200
powered AI satellites, which it pretty

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:34.159
much needs to be in order to um in in

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.919
order to harness a non-trivial amount of

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:38.799
the energy of the sun, you have to move

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:42.720
to solar powered AI satellites in deep

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:46.240
space. um which somewhat is a confluence

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:47.760
of Tesla expertise and SpaceX expertise

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:52.400
um

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.840
and XAI on the the AI front. So

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.440
it does feel like over time there's

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.039
somewhat of a convergence there. Um but

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.200
all the companies are doing doing great

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:05.039
things. Um very proud of the teams. They

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:07.520
do great work. Um so you know we're

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:08.720
making great progress with Tesla on the

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.559
autonomous driving. I don't know if

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.960
you've tried the self-driving.

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:11.679
>> Mhm.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.280
>> Have you tried it?

00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:13.919
>> I've tried it in the Whimo, not in the

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.080
Tesla.

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:17.760
>> Yeah, it's worth

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.640
>> uh We actually have it here in in

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.520
Austin, so you can

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.720
>> I'd love to try it.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.440
>> You can you can literally just download

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.760
Tesla app.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.679
>> Yeah.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.320
>> And I and I think I think it's open to

00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:27.039
to any to anyone. Definitely try it out.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.159
I mean,

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:32.559
>> you know, let me know how it goes. Um

00:22:30.159 --> 00:22:35.280
but uh you know we've made a lot of

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:38.960
progress with electric vehicles with uh

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:42.240
battery packs and solar and but and very

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:46.320
much so with self-driving. So basically

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:49.520
real world AI um Tesla is the world

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.360
leader in real world AI I would say. So,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.000
um, and then we're going to be making

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.520
this robot Optimus, which is, you know,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.919
starting production hopefully some next

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:01.200
year, um, at scale. Um, and I think

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.799
that's going to be pretty cool. That'll

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.159
be like I think everyone's going to want

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:08.080
their own personal C3PO R2-D2,

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:11.840
>> you know, helper help a robot. Like, it

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:14.960
would be pretty cool. Um and then SpaceX

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:18.640
is doing great work with the Starlink

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.799
program, you know, providing uh lowcost,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.760
reliable uh internet throughout the

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:24.559
world.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.080
>> Hopefully India. So we'd love to be

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:27.679
operating in India. That would be great.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.679
We're operating in 150 different

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:31.520
countries now with Starlink.

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:33.120
>> Can you give me a bit about Starlink and

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.440
how the tech works

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.480
>> cuz somebody I was speaking to uh I

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.039
don't know if you know this company

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.480
called meter out of San Francisco. uh

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:42.000
they're trying to replace network

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.720
engineers, but

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.919
>> I know it now.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:49.120
>> Um so he was telling me about how in

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:51.600
densely populated areas, Starlink works

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.840
differently than it might be in a place

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.200
with not as many people. Can you explain

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.000
how it works?

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.840
>> Yeah, so Starink um there's several

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.320
thousand satellites in low Earth orbit

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.520
and they're moving around 25 times the

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.720
speed of sound um in these, you know,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:11.279
they're zipping around the Earth

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:14.000
basically. And um they're uh they're at

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:14.559
an altitude of about 550 km.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.559
>> Mhm.

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:19.039
>> Um which is called generally low earth

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:21.919
orbit. Um because they're they're at low

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:24.159
earth orbit, they're um the latency is

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:26.080
is low like the the distance because the

00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:30.080
distance is is not that far compared to

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:34.559
a geostationary satellite uh 36,000 km.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:38.080
Um so you've you've got um

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:41.840
thousands of satellites providing uh low

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:44.240
latency high-speed internet throughout

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.960
the world and

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.039
um and they are interconnected as well.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.799
So there's there are laser laser links

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:53.760
between the satellites. So it forms sort

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:56.640
of a a laser mesh so that the if if

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.559
let's say uh fi let's say if cables are

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.559
damaged or cut like fiber cables the

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:04.320
satellites can communicate between each

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:06.559
other um and provide connectivity uh

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.880
even if uh there's there's a uh the

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:12.000
cables are cut so for example when the

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.880
red sea cables were cut uh I think a few

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.279
months ago

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.520
>> the satellite the the stinking satellite

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:18.400
network continued to function without a

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.240
hitchh

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.799
>> so it's it's particularly helpful for

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.120
disaster areas. So, but if an area has

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:27.679
been hit with uh some kind of natural

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.000
disaster, floods or fires or

00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:32.480
earthquakes, that that tends to damage

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.360
the the ground infrastructure. Uh but

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.440
the Starink satellites still work. So,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.039
um and generally when whenever there's

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.720
some sort of natural disaster somewhere,

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:43.360
we we always provide people with free

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.559
Starlink uh internet connectivity. You

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.679
know, we don't want to charge we don't

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:51.600
take advantage of a a tragic situation.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:54.240
So, um, so always, you know, if there's

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.840
natural disasters, we like, okay, it's

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.000
it's free during the natural disaster.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.000
You know, we we don't want to say like,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.640
um, you know, put a pay wall up while

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.320
somebody's trying to get help. That

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.880
would be wrong. Um, so so that's it's

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.720
it's it's a very robust system. It's

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.559
it's complimentary to ground systems

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:19.120
because uh the satellite beams um work

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:21.520
best in uh sparsely populated areas. Um

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.120
but because you you've got a you've got

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.120
a satellite beam, it's a pretty big

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.080
beam. So you have a and you have a fixed

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.480
number of users per beam. So, um, it

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.559
tends to be very complimentary to the

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.799
groundbased cellular systems because

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:36.159
those are those are very good in cities

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:38.400
because you've got these cell towers

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:39.840
that are, you know, only a kilometer

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.080
apart type of thing.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.919
>> But, uh,

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.720
but but but cell towers tend to be

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:49.279
inefficient in the countryside. So in in

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.000
uh rural rural areas is where you tend

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:53.520
to have the worst internet because uh

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.919
it's very very expensive and difficult

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.440
to lay to do all these do all the fiber

00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:02.960
optic cables uh or to have um high

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:06.799
bandwidth cellular towers. So Starlink

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:10.480
is very complimentary to the existing

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:12.400
telecom companies. Um it it basically

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.840
tends to serve the serve the least

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.120
served which I think is is good. Um

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.520
that's um

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.760
>> will that change tomorrow? Like today as

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.760
you explained the the beam is quite

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.520
broad and it can't work in a densely

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.360
populated area with high buildings

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.039
maybe.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.279
>> But can that change and tomorrow it

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:33.679
becomes really efficient

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:35.279
in a densely populated city where it is

00:27:33.679 --> 00:27:36.320
competitive with the local network

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:38.640
providers?

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.720
>> It's it's unfortunately so the physics

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:45.200
don't allow for that. So

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:47.919
>> we're too far away. Um so at 550 km and

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.640
even if we try to reduce it which about

00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:54.000
as low as we can go is about 350 km

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.760
still very far away you you you've just

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
you can think of like a like a

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.399
flashlight which is it's you know that

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.480
flashlight's got a cone and and and that

00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:06.799
that cone is is coming at you know today

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.200
550 km in the future we try to get down

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:11.600
to 350 km but we can't beat something

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.919
that's 1 kilometer away which the cell

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.559
tower uh physics is not on our side

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:16.080
here,

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:20.399
>> right? So it's not it's not physically

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:22.080
possible for us for stalling to serve uh

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:24.080
densely populated cities like you can

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.159
serve a little bit maybe 1% of the

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.320
population and sometimes people get you

00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:31.760
know even in in crowded cities there

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.600
might be you know no fiber link up their

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.960
road like sometimes somebody's on a

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.399
culde-sac or something or in a a place

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.919
in in cities there are sometimes

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:46.399
underserved areas for random reasons and

00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:50.640
so can serve like said maybe 1% or 2% of

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:52.880
of of a densely populated city. Um, but

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.440
it can be much more effective in like I

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.520
said in rural areas where the internet

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.000
connection is much worse and often

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.840
people either have sometimes no access

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.679
to internet or it's extremely expensive

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.080
or the quality is not very good.

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:07.919
So

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.279
>> if I were to ask you to wager a guess

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:14.000
Elon, do you think India will go down

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:16.320
the path of urbanization like China did

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.720
with more people moving in from rural

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:21.440
economies to urban centers? Um or do you

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.440
think we

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.720
>> I suppose some some amount of that has

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.399
happened, right? Um I mean I'm actually

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.880
I I'm curious to sort of ask you some

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:33.120
questions as well. Is because of course

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.039
isn't isn't that the trend or is it not

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.960
the trend in India?

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:39.279
It is the trend largely. I think a

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.000
little bit changed during co when a lot

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:44.640
of urbanization slowed down and that was

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
not organic. It was very artificially

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.200
artificially manifested.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.200
>> Right?

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:56.320
>> But one does question that

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:59.600
with AI if productivity were to go up

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.720
and I heard you speak about UHI instead

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.679
of UBI.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.120
>> Yeah. Uh

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:04.000
>> I think I think it will be universal

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.080
high income.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.600
>> In a world like that, I wonder if more

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:13.120
people want to live in cities which are

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.360
always going to be more polluted

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.080
and not offer the quality of lifestyle

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.480
that a rural environment might.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.840
>> Well, I guess it's up to some people

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.200
want to be around a lot of people and

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.799
some people don't. You know, it's going

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.640
to be a maybe a matter of personal

00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:28.720
choice. But I think in the future it

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.760
won't be I I think it won't be the case

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.399
that you have to be in a city for a job.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.840
Um because I I think I I my prediction

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:36.960
is in the future working will be

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.399
optional,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.320
>> right?

00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:42.640
>> We seem to be moving from not in India

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.880
but in in some parts of the west from 6

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:49.240
days to 5 days to 4 days to three.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.240
>> Uh not me.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.559
>> I think the Europeans.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:58.880
>> Yeah. Yeah. Uh

00:30:54.559 --> 00:31:00.720
um yeah. Yeah. There's I mean I I think

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.080
if you're trying to make a startup

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:06.080
succeed or you're trying to make a

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:07.679
company do very difficult things then

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.440
you you you definitely need to put in

00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:09.840
serious hours. I think that's

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.080
>> right.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.559
>> That's how it goes.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.640
>> And if we were to move from 5 to 4 to 3

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:19.200
days, how do you think society changes

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.440
when people have to work half the week?

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.720
What do they do with the other half?

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.480
Well, I I think it'll actually be that

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.679
people don't have to work at all in the

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:31.440
in the um and it may not be that far in

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:33.840
the future. Maybe only I don't know 10 I

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.840
say less than 20 years.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.760
In less my prediction is less than in

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.039
less than 20 years working will be

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.039
optional. working at all will be

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:42.039
optional

00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:46.960
like a hobby

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:49.760
pretty much

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.679
>> and that would be because of increased

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.720
productivity meaning people do not have

00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:55.760
to work

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.519
>> they don't have to I mean look this

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.200
obviously people can play this back in

00:31:57.519 --> 00:32:01.039
20 years and say look Elon made this

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.279
ridiculous pred prediction and it's not

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:07.039
true but I think it will turn out to be

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:10.880
true that in less than 20 years maybe

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:14.480
even as little as I don't know 10 or 15

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:17.600
years um the advancements in AI and

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:20.559
robotics will

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:22.399
bring us to the point where working is

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:25.360
optional

00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:26.799
um in the same way that like say you

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.720
could you can grow your own vegetables

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:32.519
in your garden or you could go to the

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.519
store and buy vegetables

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.519
you know

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.720
>> it's much harder to grow your own

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:38.240
vegetables

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.760
But but you know some people like to

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.559
grow their vegetables which is fine you

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:45.200
know um but it it'll be optional in that

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:48.240
way is my prediction.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:50.559
>> If one were to argue that humans are

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.679
innately competitive and everything is

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:55.279
relative from the time of hunters.

00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:58.640
Somebody wanted to be the alpha hunter

00:32:55.279 --> 00:33:01.519
or the biggest farmer. If everybody gets

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.679
a universal high income and everybody

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:06.960
has enough

00:33:03.679 --> 00:33:08.640
>> what do you compete for? Uh, it would be

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.760
relative, right? Like if we all had

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.760
enough, enough is not enough.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.320
>> Um,

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:19.120
yeah. I I guess I I I'm not exactly

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:20.880
sure. Um, cuz we're we're really headed

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.720
into

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.039
the singularity as it's called, which

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.720
you know, they refer to AI sometimes as

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:27.919
the kind of like a black hole, like a

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.919
singularity. You don't know what happens

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:31.760
after the event horizon. It doesn't mean

00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:35.120
that something bad happens. It just

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:37.120
means you don't know what happens. Um,

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.279
so

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.440
like I'm I'm confident that if AI and

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:44.080
robotics continue to advance, which they

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:48.159
are advancing very rapidly, like I said,

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:50.000
working will be optional. Um, and people

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:52.240
will have any goods and services that

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.559
they want.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:58.240
Um, if you if you can think of it, you

00:33:54.559 --> 00:34:01.279
can have it type of thing. Um

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:04.480
and but then at a certain point

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:06.799
AI will actually saturate on anything

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.200
humans can think of

00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:13.119
and then at at that point it it becomes

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:14.800
a situation where AI is doing things for

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:16.240
AI and robotics are doing things for AI

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.560
and robotics because they've run out of

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:21.919
things to do to make the humans happy

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.560
you know because there's a limit you

00:34:21.919 --> 00:34:28.079
know they say like there's only people

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:30.800
can only eat so much food or

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:32.480
you know if but I it's going to be I

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.320
think if you can think of it you can

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.919
have it will be the future

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.839
>> you know the Austrian school of

00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:41.200
economics if you go back in time they

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:43.200
were the digression from Adam Smith

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.200
>> they talk about the marginal utility of

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.520
everything

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.440
having one of something has value having

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.520
two of the same thing has lesser value

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.399
and having 10 of the same thing has no

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.720
value

00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:55.119
>> yes

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:59.399
>> so if we could have everything we wanted

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:59.399
10 marshmallows. I mean, who wants that?

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:04.400
>> One's one's plenty.

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:05.599
>> It's like the marshmallow taste. You're

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.760
like, you can have two marshmallows

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:09.040
later or one marshmallow now. And I'm

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.839
like, I'll have one marshmallow. I don't

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.240
want two marshmallows.

00:35:09.839 --> 00:35:13.599
>> That's interesting.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.520
>> What would you pick?

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:17.680
>> Well, I I don't One marshmallow is

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.680
enough. I always question marshmallows

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.200
as being like not the most, you know,

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.760
the best candy, you know?

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.000
>> Yeah.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.240
Well, I don't yearn for marshmallows.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.240
>> I think you're the best.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.839
>> Who does?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.920
>> You're the best testament to the

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:36.160
marshmallow experiment. I think

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.520
>> I suppose so. Well, I mean, like delayed

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.920
gratification essentially.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.440
>> Yeah.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.800
>> You were able to delay it more than

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.160
most. You know, I have a tattoo which

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.680
says delay gratification.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.720
>> Yeah. Wow. Okay. What's this? Okay.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.720
You're really taking the marshmallow

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.720
test.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.800
>> I feel like I can't remember when I'm

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.560
trading or when I'm buying into

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.359
>> delay gratification. Yeah. Yeah,

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.200
>> it helps.

00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:59.960
>> Wow. Okay, that's a good

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.960
>> It's pointing at me, so it reminds me of

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.480
>> Okay. Well, that's it's good advice. I

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.040
mean, you can't miss it.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.480
>> If you could get

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.160
>> If you could get a tattoo, what would

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.680
you get?

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.160
>> I guess maybe my kids' names or

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.240
something,

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.480
>> right?

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.000
>> Why do you like the letter X as much as

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.000
you do?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Well,

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.440
I mean, yeah, it's a good question.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:33.480
Honestly, sometimes I wonder what what's

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.480
wrong with me. Um

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:44.640
um so um I mean it started off with

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:48.560
where I think so way back in ancient

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.560
times in 99

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:55.359
the pre the pre-Cambian era when there

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:58.000
were only sponges. Um the

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:59.839
I I there were only three onelet domain

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.079
names um

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:06.320
>> and I think it was XQ and Z and uh and I

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:09.280
was like okay I want to have create this

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.440
place where it's the um

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.800
the financial crossroads or like the the

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:18.960
financial exchange you know um

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:20.880
>> um it's essentially solving money from

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.440
an information theory standpoint where

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:27.520
the current banking system is is a large

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:31.520
number of uh heterogeneous databases

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:36.160
with batch processing that uh are not

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:38.320
secure. Um, and if we could have a

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.800
a a sort of a single database that was

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:44.960
real time and uh secure, that would be

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:48.160
more efficient from a monetary from an

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.920
information theory standpoint than, you

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.640
know, a large number of heterogeneous

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:58.079
databases that batch process very slowly

00:37:52.640 --> 00:38:00.880
and securely. Um, so, um, so that that

00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:03.920
was that was sort of X.com way back in

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:07.040
the day, which kind of, um, became

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:10.400
PayPal. Um,

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:12.400
and then um,

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.520
and was acquired by eBay. And then eBay,

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.280
someone reached out from eBay and said,

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.119
"Hey, do you want to buy the domain name

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.560
back?" And I was like, "Sure." You know,

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:22.560
and so I had the domain name for quite a

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:25.599
while. Um

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:29.599
and then uh

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:32.160
and then yes then I was like well maybe

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:35.440
this may maybe this acquiring Twitter

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:39.599
would also be an opportunity to

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:42.720
revisit the original plan of of X.com

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:45.359
which is to create this um

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.119
this like clearing house of

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:50.400
of financial transactions like like

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:52.800
basically to create a more efficient

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.920
datab money database is a way to think

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:59.599
about it is um like like people like

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.839
money is really a an information system

00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:03.280
for labor allocation like people think

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:04.720
sometimes think money is power in and of

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.480
itself but it it doesn't it doesn't

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.720
really it's if there's no labor to

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.280
allocate it it's meaningless. So if you

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:14.160
were to be on a desert island with a

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.119
trillion you know dollars or whatever

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.079
doesn't matter.

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:20.400
>> Oh yeah. Why speculate when you can be

00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:20.400
real?

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.160
I just hope I don't end up on a desert

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:29.520
island, you know, it's not going to be

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:32.079
very useful to me. Um, but but it

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.839
illustrates my point that if if you're

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:35.760
if you're stranded on a on a on a desert

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:38.880
island with a trillion dollars, it's not

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.400
useful because there's no there's no

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.400
labor to allocate. You just allocate

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:47.280
yourself. So um

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:51.599
so so it's so anyway so it's so this

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:54.160
longwinded way of saying that it's uh

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:57.359
it it's just really like

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:59.520
I'm I'm just kind of slowly building

00:39:57.359 --> 00:40:03.280
revisiting this idea that I had 25 years

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:06.280
ago to create a more efficient

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.280
um

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.359
money database. Um,

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.640
and and if that's successful, people

00:40:11.359 --> 00:40:15.599
will use it. If it's not successful,

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.280
they won't use it. Um, you know, and and

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:20.079
and then I also like the idea of like

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.480
sort of having a unified

00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:24.960
app or or or website or whatever where

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:29.119
you can do like it can you can do

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:31.680
anything you want there. Um, so you

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:34.079
know, sort of China has this with WeChat

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.079
somewhat, you know, where you can

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:38.079
>> you you can exchange information, you

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:41.359
can publish information, you can

00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:43.359
exchange money, uh, you can um, you

00:40:41.359 --> 00:40:45.839
know, you sort of people kind of live

00:40:43.359 --> 00:40:47.680
their life on WeChat in in China. It's

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:50.240
and it's it's it's quite useful, but

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.880
there's no u there's no real WeChat

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.359
outside of China. Um, so it's like it's

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.680
kind of WeChat++

00:40:55.359 --> 00:41:01.200
I'd say is is the idea for for X.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.880
Anyway, so then, uh, Space Exploration

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.400
Technologies is the full name of the

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.720
company, but I was like, that's too

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.880
much. That's a mouthful. So I was like,

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.160
we'll just call it SpaceX, like FedEx

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.880
for space.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:16.000
>> Um, it just hasn't happens to have X in

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:18.240
the, you know, cuz exploration has an X,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.079
but you know, and I was like, well, I

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:24.240
like the idea of capitalizing the X just

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:26.880
artistically. So, um, so then, uh,

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.960
that's why it's SpaceX. But, uh, and

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.640
then, um, what else have we got? We got

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.800
a kid.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:38.240
>> Uh, he's called X2. Um, but that's his

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.440
mother is the one that named him X.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.359
>> And I said, you know, people are really

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.000
going to think I've got a thing about X

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:46.560
if we name our kid X2, you know, and and

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.480
I I said to her, like, look, I do have

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.720
X.com, you know.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.319
So, people are going to really think

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.200
I've got a somewhat of a fetish for this

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:58.640
letter. Um, but she's she said, "No, I

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.599
she likes X and she wants to call him

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.280
X." I'm like, "Okay."

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:02.160
>> Is this a new thing or have you had it

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.960
growing up?

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.960
>> No, I'm saying it's it's somewhat of a

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.400
co coincidence, you know.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.839
>> Um,

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.520
>> like not everything's called X. I mean,

00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:12.480
Tesla's there's no X's in Tesla, you

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.280
know.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.720
>> Um,

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.200
>> what do you think money will be in the

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:23.920
future, Elon?

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:26.720
I I I think I think long term

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:30.400
I think money disappears as a concept.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:33.280
Honestly, it's it's kind of strange, but

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.200
um in in a future where anyone can have

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:39.200
anything,

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:41.839
uh I think you no longer need money as a

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.800
database for labor allocation.

00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:47.200
Um if if there's if AI if AI and

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:52.079
robotics are big enough to satisfy all

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:54.000
human needs then then money is no longer

00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:55.599
it's it's relevance declines

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.480
dramatically. It's I'm not sure we will

00:42:55.599 --> 00:43:01.599
have it. So

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:04.720
you the best sort of uh imagining of

00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:08.079
this future that I've read is uh from

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:10.160
Ian Banks the culture books. So, I

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:13.599
recommend people read the culture books.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.680
You in the sort of far future of the

00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:18.880
culture books, there's they don't have

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:23.040
money either. Um, and everyone can

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:24.480
pretty much have whatever they want. So,

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.160
there there there are still some

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.200
fundamental

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:33.440
currencies, if you will, that are

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:35.119
physics- based. So, energy is energy is

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.359
the real is the true currency. This is

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:39.680
why I said Bitcoin is based on energy.

00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:42.480
You you can't legislate energy. You

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:45.680
can't just, you know, pass a law and

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:49.119
suddenly have a lot of energy. Um

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:51.119
you it's very difficult to to to

00:43:49.119 --> 00:43:53.119
generate energy or especially to harness

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:58.400
energy in a in a useful way to do useful

00:43:53.119 --> 00:44:01.200
work. So, so I think that probably

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:04.960
we we probably won't have money and

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:07.920
probably we'll just have energy,

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.200
you know, power generation as the de

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:14.240
facto currency.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:18.079
So I mean I think one way to frame

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:19.839
civilizational progress is the

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:23.119
percentage completion on the Kadeshv

00:44:19.839 --> 00:44:26.720
scale. So we're, you know, cottage one

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:29.280
is what percentage of a planet's energy

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.599
are you successfully turning into useful

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:34.480
work? And I'm maybe paraphrasing here a

00:44:31.599 --> 00:44:37.040
little bit, but a caut would be what

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:41.040
percentage of the sun's energy are you

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:43.359
converting into useful work? Um, Kesha 3

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:46.160
would be what percentage of the galaxy

00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:49.119
are you converting to useful work.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:51.200
Um

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:53.119
so so things really I think become

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.839
energy based.

00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:55.920
>> Um

00:44:53.839 --> 00:44:57.760
>> but if you have solar powered AI

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.839
satellites energy is also free and

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.480
abundant cuz we'll never be able to

00:44:59.839 --> 00:45:05.520
utilize all the solar energy available

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:09.040
to us. So it can't be a store of wealth

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:11.599
essentially in that lens can it?

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.079
you know, there's not really s you can't

00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:16.000
really store wealth in in like you you

00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:19.200
can only

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.760
you um

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.760
you you you can accumulate numbers in

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:27.200
currently currently you can accumulate

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:30.160
numbers in a database that

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.800
uh allow you to

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.720
um

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.079
to some degree to to incent the behavior

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.800
of other humans in particular

00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:38.560
directions.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.680
>> Yeah. Um, and I guess people call that

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.680
wealth. Um, but again, if if there's no

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.119
humans around, there's no wealth

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.880
accumulation is meaningless.

00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:50.400
>> It's a digression, but if you were to

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.680
consider food as the energy for a human

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.079
to thrive,

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.359
>> yeah, food is energy. It's literally got

00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:57.359
calories just means energy.

00:45:55.359 --> 00:46:01.800
>> So, can a farm which is self-sustaining

00:45:57.359 --> 00:46:01.800
be a commodity? that is

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.720
>> um

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.119
I'm not sure what that means but you

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:12.319
know there's

00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:15.359
I I I like I think the the at a certain

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:16.880
point you you do complete the the cycle

00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:19.440
where

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.520
and you I think at a certain point you

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:26.880
decouple from the the sort of

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:31.200
conventional economy if you have um

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:32.880
AI and robots producing chips and solar

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:37.599
panels

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:40.319
um and you know and mining resources in

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:43.760
order to make chips and robots in order

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:46.400
to make you you sort of complete that

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:50.079
cycle once that cycle is complete once

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.680
that that cycle is complete uh I think

00:46:50.079 --> 00:46:53.440
that's the point at which you decouple

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:56.400
from the monetary system

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:59.280
>> is that the way forward for the US by

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:02.240
virtue of

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.640
how much debt they have today. Do they

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.720
deflate away their currency and

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.119
transition into this new form and lead

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.240
that push because it would make more

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:11.680
sense to them?

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.240
>> Well, in this future that I'm talking

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:17.520
about, the notion of countries uh

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.560
becomes sort of inacronistic.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.240
Um

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.200
>> do you believe in it today? Do you

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.640
believe

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:25.040
>> I certainly believe in it today. And I I

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.440
want to just separate like something

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.920
that I like these are just what I think

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.520
will happen based on what I see as

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.359
opposed to I think these are

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.359
fundamentally good things and I'm trying

00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:36.880
to make them happen. It it's like I

00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:40.240
think this would happen with or without

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:42.640
me um whether I like it or not.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:46.160
>> Um as long as civilization keeps

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:50.480
advancing we we we will have AI and

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:53.200
robotics at very large scale. Um

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.200
the uh

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.839
I I think that that's that's pretty much

00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.400
the only thing that's going to solve for

00:47:57.839 --> 00:48:02.640
the US debt crisis. You know, the

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:06.000
because currently the US debt is

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.680
insanely high and uh the interest

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.200
payments on the debt exceed the entire

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.200
military bud budget of the United

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:13.760
States, just the interest payments. And

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:17.200
that that's that's at least in the short

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.480
term going to continue to increase. So,

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.960
so I think I think actually the only

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:24.480
thing that can solve for uh the debt

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:26.960
situation is um Zean robotics and but it

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:29.920
will more than

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.359
it might cause it pro I guess it

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.760
probably would cause significant

00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:36.640
deflation because

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.960
you know deflation or inflation is it's

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:41.599
really the ratio of goods and services

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:43.520
produced to the the change in the money

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:45.920
supply. So like so if if if goods and

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.839
services output increases faster than

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.800
money supply you will have deflation. If

00:48:47.839 --> 00:48:53.839
goods and services decreases if if real

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.280
goods and services output increases

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:58.319
slower than the money supply you have

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.520
inflation. It's that simple. People try

00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:03.839
to make it more complicated than that

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:06.640
but it but it it just isn't. Um so if

00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:07.760
you have AI and robotics and a dramatic

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.880
increase in the output of goods and

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.400
services probably you will have

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.960
deflation.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.559
That seems likely

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.800
because you you simply won't be able to

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:18.559
to increase the money supply as fast as

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.839
you can increase the output of goods and

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:20.480
services

00:49:19.839 --> 00:49:23.119
>> with all

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:26.480
>> supply is a real hazard here.

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:27.680
>> Should we do something about it?

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.079
>> Maybe we can convince it to go somewhere

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.680
else.

00:49:28.079 --> 00:49:31.119
>> Yeah.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.800
>> Entic it elsewhere.

00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:36.599
>> It actually left, I think. Okay.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.599
>> Oh no, it's back.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.319
Maybe it's attracted to the light.

00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:47.800
>> If deflation want some coffee,

00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:47.800
>> mine is over.

00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:52.400
>> If deflation is inevitable because of

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:54.640
AI, why do

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:57.119
>> That's most likely the case. Yeah.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.319
>> Right. Why do we have inflation again

00:49:57.119 --> 00:50:03.280
all over in society today? Has AI not

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:05.359
led to increased productivity yet?

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.480
uh it's not AI has not yet made enough

00:50:05.359 --> 00:50:10.480
of an impact on productivity to increase

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.200
the goods and services faster than the

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.520
increase in the money supply. So the inc

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:19.359
the US is increasing money supply quite

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:21.280
substantially with you know deficits

00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:21.760
that are on the order of $2 trillion.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:26.000
>> Yeah.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:28.480
>> Uh so so you have to have um

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.319
you know goods and services output

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.319
increase more than that in order to not

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:34.400
have inflation. So, we're not there yet.

00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:37.520
But if you say like like how long would

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.119
it take us to get there? I think it's 3

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.440
years.

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:44.240
Probably 3 years before

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:46.559
in 3 years or less

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:49.119
my my guess is goods and services output

00:50:46.559 --> 00:50:51.359
will exceed the rate of inflation like

00:50:49.119 --> 00:50:53.359
money goods and services growth will

00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:55.680
exceed money money supply growth in

00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:58.240
about 3 years.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:00.240
Maybe after those three years you have

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.160
deflation and then interest rates go to

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.359
zero and then the debt is a smaller

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.240
problem than it is.

00:51:03.359 --> 00:51:04.720
>> Yes.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.559
>> Right.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:10.559
>> That's most likely the case.

00:51:08.559 --> 00:51:12.720
>> You spoke about being in a simulation

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:13.359
earlier. I love the Matrix.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.440
>> Yes. Yes.

00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:17.760
>> If you were to be a character from the

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:19.040
Matrix, who would you be?

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.880
>> Well, there's not that many characters

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:26.000
to pick from, you know. Um hopefully not

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:29.280
Agent Smith.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.200
He's my hero.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.960
Um, I mean, Neo is pretty cool. Um, the

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.520
architect is interesting.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.000
>> Mhm.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.920
>> Um,

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.680
>> the Oracle.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:44.720
>> So, Oracle. Um, sometimes I feel like

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.079
I'm I'm an anomaly in the Matrix.

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.760
>> That is Neo.

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:49.200
>> Yeah.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.319
>> Do you believe you're in a matrix

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:54.800
though? Like actually believe?

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:56.240
I I think you have to just think of

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.520
these things as probabilities, not

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.760
certainties.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.800
>> Um there's some probability that we're

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.319
in a simulation.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.319
>> What percentage would you attribute to

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:05.319
that?

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.200
>> Probably pretty high. I would say it's

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.680
pretty high.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.040
>> Yeah.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:17.359
>> Yeah. Um, so one way to think of this is

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.680
to say if you look at the advancement of

00:52:17.359 --> 00:52:22.079
video games in in our lifetime, or at

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:24.079
least in my lifetime, it's gone from

00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:26.319
very simple video games with where

00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:28.480
you've got like Pong. You've got two

00:52:26.319 --> 00:52:32.079
rectangles in a square just batting it

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:36.559
back and forth to

00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:38.800
uh photorealistic realtime

00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:40.000
um games with millions of people playing

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:43.040
simultaneously.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.640
>> Mhm. Um,

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.680
and that's happened just in the span of

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.760
50 years. So,

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:52.079
if that trend continues, video games

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.119
will be indistinguishable from reality,

00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:57.200
>> right?

00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:59.280
>> Um, and we're also going to have very

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:01.440
intelligent characters, like non-player

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.520
characters in these video games. Think

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.119
of how sophisticated the conversations

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.960
are you could have with an AI today, and

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:09.920
that's only going to get uh more

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:12.079
sophisticated. the you you you'll be

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:14.559
able to have

00:53:12.079 --> 00:53:17.760
uh conversations that are

00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:20.160
more complex and and

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.000
more sophisticated than any almost any

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:26.559
human conversation

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:29.599
maybe maybe any um so then so you have

00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:33.839
so the future if civilization continues

00:53:29.599 --> 00:53:35.359
will be millions maybe billions of

00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:37.200
of

00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:38.480
photorealistic like indistinguishable

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.200
from reality

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:45.440
video games with characters in those

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:49.920
video games that are

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:52.800
uh very deep and and and where the the

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.960
dialogue is not pre-programmed.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.359
Um

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.960
that's for sure what's going to happen

00:53:57.359 --> 00:54:00.400
in in this in this level of the

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.960
simulation, if you could call it. So

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:06.480
then then what are the odds that we are

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:08.240
in base reality

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:11.240
and that and that this has not happened

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.240
before?

00:54:11.359 --> 00:54:17.359
>> If I were to buy into that and assume

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:20.400
that we are in a simulation

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:23.520
as Neo of the story, what do you know

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:26.400
that I don't and I can learn from? I

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:28.720
think most likely

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.480
if we if outside the simulation would be

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.559
less interesting than in the simulation

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.880
because we're most likely a distillation

00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:36.640
of what's interesting

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:42.400
because that's what we do in this that's

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:44.319
what we do in our reality. Um and then

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.800
I do also have a theory which is like

00:54:44.319 --> 00:54:51.119
the most interesting outcome is the most

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:53.599
likely outcome as seen by a third party.

00:54:51.119 --> 00:54:55.359
um the god the gods or god of the

00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:57.839
simulation

00:54:55.359 --> 00:55:00.640
um

00:54:57.839 --> 00:55:02.960
because when we do simulations

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.200
when humans do simulations

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:07.680
we we stop those simulations that are

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:10.319
not interesting.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.480
So like if SpaceX is doing simulations

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:16.960
of rocket flights,

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:18.640
>> uh the you know the the boring ones we

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.319
we we discard because they're not

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.599
they're just not we don't learn anything

00:55:20.319 --> 00:55:27.040
from those. or when when Tesla is doing

00:55:23.599 --> 00:55:29.440
uh simulations for self-driving, uh

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.920
Tesla's actually looking for the most

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.319
interesting corner cases because the the

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:37.680
normal stuff we already have plenty of

00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:40.319
of of uh data on, you know, driving on a

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:42.400
straight road on a sunny day.

00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:44.800
We don't need more of that. Uh we we

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:47.680
need like heavy weather conditions on a

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:49.599
small windy road with two cars that are

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.440
you know coming at each other with a

00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:53.440
almost head-on collision. We need like

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:57.520
weird stuff basically uh interesting

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:59.520
stuff. Um, so I think that

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.760
from a Darwinian perspective, the

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:03.760
simulations most likely to survive are

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.319
going to be the ones that are the most

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:09.440
interesting simulations,

00:56:06.319 --> 00:56:12.960
which therefore means that the most

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:16.799
interesting outcome is the most likely.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:18.960
>> And the people who simulated our world,

00:56:16.799 --> 00:56:20.880
if one were to extrapolate, they

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.520
themselves might in turn be in another

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.440
simulation.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.079
>> Yes. And there could be many layers of

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.359
simulation.

00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:26.960
>> Yes.

00:56:25.359 --> 00:56:28.559
>> Beyond all of these layers of

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.640
simulation,

00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:34.559
do you think there's something I I read

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:37.200
somewhere that you used to ascribe to

00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:38.960
Spinoza's god in a way?

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.480
>> No describ I was really just pointing

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:44.160
out that that you don't you don't have

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:46.000
to have um it's like one of the things

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:48.079
Spinoza was saying is that you don't you

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.160
you can have morals in the absolute. You

00:56:48.079 --> 00:56:54.160
don't need need to have morals to be

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:57.040
handed to you. You know, it's like the

00:56:54.160 --> 00:57:00.240
question is can morality exist outside

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.520
of a religious context and Spinosa was

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:04.000
arguing that it can.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:06.880
>> Wasn't he arguing for the laws of nature

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.960
should be where we seek our laws of

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.720
morality from to a certain extent.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:15.200
>> Yeah. But when I think of laws of

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:18.640
nature, I see a tiger eat a deer and a

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:21.359
So in Spininoza's morality, that's fair

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.440
game, right?

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:27.720
Um

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:27.720
well um

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.799
you can I I think there's a lot of

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.200
things you can take from from Spinosa,

00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:37.200
but I the only point I was making in

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:42.480
referencing Spinosa was that that you

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:45.599
you can have a set of of of morals that

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:47.520
that make society functional um and

00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:51.040
productive

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:52.400
with and in but without you you don't

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:59.440
necessarily have to have religious

00:57:52.400 --> 00:58:01.119
doctrine for that. Um, so that's uh,

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.599
yeah, I think that's that's the main

00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:05.440
thing I was trying to say there.

00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:10.240
>> Like like I don't think people just like

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:13.839
if somebody is it doesn't if if there's

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:15.359
if if there's not like a commandment not

00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:16.960
to kill, you know, like people doesn't

00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:20.640
mean somebody's without that they will

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:22.400
run around murdering people, you know,

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.760
like you don't you don't have to have a

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.040
commandment not to kill. Have you played

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:30.720
GTA religious edict to run around

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:32.240
people? I I actually I I've only played

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:36.079
a little bit of GTA cuz I didn't like

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:39.040
the fact that um like in GTA 5 you

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:42.720
literally can't pro progress unless you

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:46.400
killed the police. And I'm like

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:49.839
this doesn't work for me. Um I actually

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:53.200
don't like killing the NPCs in the video

00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:55.920
games. It's not my thing, you know. So,

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:57.920
um, actually I didn't like I didn't like

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.839
GTA cuz it I actually stopped when it

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.960
said you have to know way to proceed to

00:58:59.839 --> 00:59:01.520
shoot at the police. I'm like, I don't

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.920
want to do that.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:10.520
>> Maybe that's why us as the NPCs of our

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:10.520
simulation are not dying. Maybe um

00:59:11.119 --> 00:59:14.000
you know anyway I think you can just

00:59:12.319 --> 00:59:15.839
sort of say there's some common sense

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.720
things that

00:59:15.839 --> 00:59:21.839
you know any civilization that

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:23.920
uh runs around you know where people

00:59:21.839 --> 00:59:27.799
just murder each other wantingly is not

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.799
going to be a very successful one.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.480
You seem to be changing a bit towards

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:35.200
religion though faith like off late

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.359
you've said a bunch of things which are

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.359
pro- religion almost not pro- religion

00:59:37.359 --> 00:59:40.359
but

00:59:40.799 --> 00:59:45.520
on those lines I

00:59:42.799 --> 00:59:47.680
>> I mean I think are there other religious

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:51.359
are there principles in religion that

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:56.000
make sense yeah I think there are um

00:59:51.359 --> 00:59:57.599
>> is it easier for our simulation to have

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.760
a pro- relligion

00:59:57.599 --> 01:00:02.000
projection for the world that we live

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.200
in. We become more relatable. It's

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.799
easier.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.960
>> Well, which religion though?

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:10.160
>> Any depending on where you live?

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.799
>> So, pick one, you know.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.920
>> Um, it's it's pretty rare that kids are

01:00:12.799 --> 01:00:16.240
said, you know, which religion would you

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.760
like, you know,

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.520
it's pretty rare, right?

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.960
>> I don't know too many situations where

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.880
kids got were offered like, you know,

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:28.640
uh, you know, like what what do you want

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:31.359
to major in type of thing. Uh

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.440
it's usually like they you get you get

01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:37.920
given a religion by your parents and

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:41.720
your community. Um, so

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.720
you know, um,

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:47.280
but you know, I mean, I think,

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.599
you know, there's there's

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:54.559
good things in in in in in all religions

01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:56.240
that are good principles um

01:00:54.559 --> 01:00:58.000
that you you can sort of read any

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.760
religious text and say, "Okay, this is a

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.119
good principle. This is going to be this

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.520
is going to lead to a better society

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:08.160
most likely, you know." Um so

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.920
um I mean in Christianity sort of love

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.440
thy neighbor as thyself which is you

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:15.599
know have empathy for fellow human

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.680
beings uh is a good one I think for uh

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:21.359
good society you know uh basically just

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.720
consider the feelings of others and uh

01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:25.359
treat treat other people as you would

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.680
like to be treated.

01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:29.520
If you had to redraw, resketch the

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:34.480
world, Elon,

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:37.119
uh, think morality, politics, economy,

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:39.680
how would you change the world we live

01:01:37.119 --> 01:01:42.480
in today?

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.880
>> Um, if you had to have Elon simulation

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.200
of things,

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.359
>> well, overall, I think the world is is

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.960
pretty great right now. I mean it's it's

01:01:49.359 --> 01:01:55.920
uh you know anyone who thinks that like

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.079
today's world is not

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.440
that great. I I think they're they're

01:01:58.079 --> 01:02:03.240
not going to be excellent students of

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.240
history cuz if you

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.480
>> if you read a lot of history like wow

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.359
there's a lot of misery back then you

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.720
know um I mean it used to be that you

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:12.799
you know people would be dropping dead

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.760
of the plague all the time you know

01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:16.880
>> part of the course.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.799
>> Yeah. you know, just be like a good a

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.640
good year back in the day would be like

01:02:18.799 --> 01:02:22.880
not that many people died of the plague

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.960
or starvation or being killed by the

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.319
another tribe.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.319
>> It's like that was good year. We only

01:02:26.319 --> 01:02:30.240
lost 10% of the population, you know?

01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:32.160
>> Like

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.160
I think like 100 years ago we lived up

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.839
until 35 or 40, right?

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.400
>> We had very high infant mortality.

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:41.440
>> Yeah. Um, so like you do had had a few

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:44.480
people that that would live to an old

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:47.359
age, but you know, not that long ago,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.720
100 years ago, if you got um like some

01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:51.040
minor infection, they didn't have

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:55.040
antibiotics. So you just like kick the

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.799
bucket because you, you know, drank some

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.319
water that had dentry and that was it.

01:02:56.799 --> 01:03:01.440
Curtains, you know,

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:03.119
>> just die of diarrhea.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.240
>> Maybe that's just literally that was

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:08.079
like that's miserable.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.960
Maybe that's why people had as many kids

01:03:08.079 --> 01:03:10.640
as they did back then.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.319
>> Yeah. I mean, if you didn't, then you

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.760
know, you

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:14.480
>> you know, like half the kids would die

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.359
type of thing.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.000
>> Yeah.

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:17.760
>> So,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
>> you have a lot of kids now.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.799
>> Yeah.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.400
Like an army.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:27.400
>> I'm trying to get a an entire Roman

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.400
legion.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:35.599
>> Um so, um yeah. Um well I have like a

01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:38.640
some older kids that are you know adults

01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:40.240
essentially you know um and then a bunch

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.240
of younger kids.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.119
>> So um

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.640
>> do you still believe in the concept of

01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:49.520
not still do you believe that the

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.440
concept of one child, one mother, one

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.520
father works?

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.559
>> I I think that it does work for most

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.079
people. Yeah.

01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:58.079
>> Right.

01:03:56.079 --> 01:04:01.680
like that's, you know, something like

01:03:58.079 --> 01:04:03.039
that is is going to be generally the uh

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.520
that's what that's what works for most

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:08.079
people. Um,

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.960
you know, so um

01:04:08.079 --> 01:04:10.960
>> changing though

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.920
>> I I and and I mean I'm not sure if you

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.599
if you know this but like um you know my

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.799
my partner Siobhan you know she's she's

01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:17.280
she's half Indian. I don't know if you

01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:17.920
know that.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.559
>> I didn't know that.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.039
>> Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:25.599
>> Yeah. Um and um uh one of my sons with

01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:26.960
her is is uh middle name is Seeker after

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:27.839
Chandra Secker.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.000
>> Wow.

01:04:27.839 --> 01:04:32.079
>> Yeah.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.280
>> Very interesting.

01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:39.760
Did she spend any time in India? Shimon.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:41.760
>> Uh no she grew up in Canada.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.400
>> You mean origins?

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.200
>> That's right.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.119
>> Ancestry like Oh. Um

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.640
>> her parents or grandparents were from

01:04:47.119 --> 01:04:53.200
there?

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:54.960
Yes. Yes. Yes. Her her father uh I mean

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.680
she was she was given up for adoption

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.240
when she was a baby. Um so I think I

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.119
think

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:03.119
>> I think her father was like a

01:05:01.119 --> 01:05:04.400
like an like an exchange student at the

01:05:03.119 --> 01:05:08.000
university or something like that. I'm

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.359
not sure the exact details but um it you

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.079
know it was kind of thing where I don't

01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:17.280
know she was uh g given up for adoption

01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:19.280
um and um

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.839
yeah so but she grew up in Canada.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.680
>> Would you adopt kids?

01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:28.000
>> You know I I definitely have my handful

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:31.680
hands full right now. Um, so no, I'm not

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000
opposed to it, but it's like, um, you

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.079
know, I I I do want to have be able to

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
spend some time with my kids, you know.

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:40.640
So, it's

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.319
>> um, you know, right before coming here,

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:49.200
I mean, I was with um, you know, with

01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:50.480
with my my with my kids. Um, so just,

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.559
you know, seeing them before bedtime,

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.480
that kind of thing. So, you know, beyond

01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:56.640
a certain number, it's like it's kind of

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.960
impossible to spend time with them. But

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:02.880
like my like I said, my my older kids,

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:07.200
they're uh very independent. You know,

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:09.440
they're in university and uh

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.000
so they're they're um you know,

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.079
especially sons when when they get past

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.599
certain age, it's like they're very

01:06:14.079 --> 01:06:20.240
independent. you know, it's like

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:21.599
uh most most uh boys don't talk to their

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.400
they they don't spend a lot of time with

01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:27.680
their parents after age 18, you know.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:30.880
So, um so I see them once in a while,

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.599
but they're very independent. Um

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:36.240
so then uh

01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:39.039
you know, I can only have enough kids on

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.480
the young side that that like it's where

01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:41.760
it's humanly possible to spend time with

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.920
them.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:47.839
So um

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:51.520
>> any views on the future of marriage,

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:53.839
family? What do you think happens to uh

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.440
people having lesser kids everywhere

01:06:53.839 --> 01:06:57.680
including India? I think our

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.160
replenishment rate is down to

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.119
>> right

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.559
>> I mean our fertility

01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:01.039
>> it dropped below replacement rate I

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:02.160
believe last year

01:07:01.039 --> 01:07:02.799
>> below 2.1.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.640
>> Yeah.

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:08.319
>> What do you think happens tomorrow? Does

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:10.319
the world just get older and then there

01:07:08.319 --> 01:07:12.640
is a phase where the world again is

01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:14.559
replenished but with a less with a

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.799
smaller population than we had to go

01:07:14.559 --> 01:07:17.799
begin with.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.920
>> I mean I do worry about the population

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.960
decline. This is a big big problem.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.640
>> Why is that?

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.480
>> Well I I don't want humanity to

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.319
disappear.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.440
>> But a decline and disappear are

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:35.119
completely different things, right?

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.839
Well, if the trend continues, it just we

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:40.000
disappear. Uh but but but also going

01:07:37.839 --> 01:07:42.160
back to you know my philosophy if you

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.680
will which is that we want to expand

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:50.119
consciousness then fewer humans is worse

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.119
because uh we have less consciousness.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:58.000
>> Do you think consciousness will go up by

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.079
virtue of the number of people in there?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.880
>> Yes.

01:08:00.079 --> 01:08:05.520
I mean just like consciousness increases

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:10.880
from a single cell creature to you know

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:13.119
a 30 trillion cell creature. Um

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:18.000
we're are more conscious than a bacteria

01:08:13.119 --> 01:08:20.159
at least it seems that way. Um so a

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.040
larger you know human population would

01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:25.199
be have increased consciousness. We're

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.839
more likely to understand

01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:32.799
the answers

01:08:27.839 --> 01:08:35.600
to the nature of the universe if we have

01:08:32.799 --> 01:08:38.600
a lot of more people than if we have

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.600
fewer.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.040
>> Right.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:47.920
I don't have kids.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:50.560
>> Well, it's uh maybe you should. Yeah.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:52.480
>> A lot of people tell me I should.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.920
>> You won't regret it.

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:58.880
What's the best thing about having kids?

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.880
>> Well, I mean, you've got this

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.880
uh

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.679
I I mean, you've got this little

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:11.319
creature that loves you and you love

01:09:05.679 --> 01:09:11.319
this little creature. Um and uh

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.880
you you I don't know you you kind of see

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:19.839
the world through their eyes as they

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.679
you know as they grow up and the the

01:09:19.839 --> 01:09:24.159
their conscious awareness increases you

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:25.679
know from a baby that has no idea what's

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:28.960
going on can't survive by itself can't

01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:31.040
even walk around can't talk to you they

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.600
stop walking

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:35.120
then talking and then having interesting

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.520
thoughts

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.520
and Um

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:45.279
but but yeah, I mean I I I think we we

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:48.319
fundamentally have to

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:50.480
have kids or or go extinct, you know.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:53.120
It's like uh

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.679
>> is there any ego in having a child? I

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:58.239
often think of this when I see my

01:09:55.679 --> 01:10:01.120
friends with their kids. They're all

01:09:58.239 --> 01:10:02.960
seeing a reflection of themsel in their

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.560
children. It's almost like

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.760
>> Well, yeah. I mean, it's cuz Apple's not

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.960
going to fall that far from the tree.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.000
You know, um

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.000
or something's wrong,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
>> right?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.239
>> You're like, "Wait a second."

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:25.440
>> Yeah.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:28.320
>> The So, I'll give I'll give you the

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.080
example of a friend of mine who has a

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.960
child and each time the child does

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.080
something good

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.440
>> Yeah.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:39.360
There is almost a sense of ownership and

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.360
pride where his ego is satiated

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.360
because the kid is like a extension of

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.360
himself.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.120
>> Um

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.360
>> so is it valid? kids are going to be

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:51.280
like, you know, half you genetically and

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:54.239
and then, you know, to the degree that

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.320
they're like growing up around you,

01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:59.440
they're there's going to be some

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:03.120
transfer of

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:07.520
I don't know, understanding like they're

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.120
going to learn from you. Um, so

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.120
so then you know, yeah, obviously kids

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.560
are just, you know, going to be half

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:15.280
Yeah, just half you from a hardware

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:18.080
standpoint. and

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.199
and then and then like I don't know some

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:23.840
portion you from a software standpoint

01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:27.360
you know not to make sort of cold

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:31.760
analogies or anything but it's just uh

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:35.199
you know just obviously going to be some

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.080
yeah they're going to be pretty close to

01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:37.920
to you.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.840
>> Do you pick a side in the nature versus

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.520
nurture debate?

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.360
Um I think there's hardware and software

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.320
and it's it's a it's a false dichotomy

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.040
essentially at least there's

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.560
um

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.679
you know once you understand that that a

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.960
human is like there's

01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:56.239
there's a bone structure there's a

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.159
muscle structure there's there's a

01:11:56.239 --> 01:12:00.080
there's a there's a if you think of a

01:11:58.159 --> 01:12:02.960
brain as somewhat of a biological

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.239
computer there's there's a circuit effic

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.840
there's a number of circuits question

01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:10.000
and and circuit efficiency from uh a

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.560
strength and dexterity standpoint point

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.600
there's the there's a speed of which at

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:19.920
which the muscles can actuate and and

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:21.760
the reactions can take place. Um

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.400
so

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:28.159
then the potential within that hardware

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:31.280
is set by the software. So that's the

01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:34.159
that's it.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.199
So for our audience like I said earlier

01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:39.920
uh young, ambitious, hungry wannabe

01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:42.880
entrepreneurs in India,

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.640
I said something recently which uh I

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.520
think got blown out of proportion where

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:50.000
I was suggesting that a MBA degree might

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.239
not make sense anymore if they were to

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.560
be deciding on what to study.

01:12:52.239 --> 01:12:53.920
>> Yeah.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.400
>> Do you think kids should go to college

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.800
anymore?

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:01.280
Well, I mean I I think if you want to go

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:05.760
to college for

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:10.880
uh social reasons, I think which is a I

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:15.040
think a reason to go um to be around

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:18.800
people your own age um in a in a

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:20.960
learning environment. Um

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.920
will will these skills be necessary in

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:27.199
the future? probably not because we're

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:31.040
going to be in like a postwork society.

01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:33.440
Um, but I think if if if something's of

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.480
of interest, it's fine to go and study

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.800
that. Um,

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.800
you know, to study that

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.000
the sciences are the arts and sciences.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.719
Um,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.640
>> is college a bit too generalized and not

01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:53.600
specific from that lens?

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:58.080
No, I I

01:13:53.600 --> 01:14:00.400
you know the Yeah. Um

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.480
>> I actually think it's it's good to take

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.840
a wide range of courses at college if

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.159
you're going to go to college.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.520
>> Mhm.

01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:08.719
>> Um I don't think I don't think you have

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:10.719
to go to college, but I think if you do,

01:14:08.719 --> 01:14:14.159
you should try to learn learn as much as

01:14:10.719 --> 01:14:17.159
possible um across a wide range of

01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:17.159
subjects.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.480
But uh like I said the AI and robots

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:26.000
this AI and robotics is a supersonic

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:29.040
tsunami. So

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.800
this is really going to be

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.320
the most radical change that we've ever

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.320
seen.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.320
Um,

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.600
you know, when I've talked to my my

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.600
older sons, I, you know, I said like,

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.000
you know, you guys, they're they're

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:47.199
pretty steeped in technology, and they

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.120
they agree that that AI will probably

01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:50.159
make their skills unnecessary in the

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.159
future, but they still want to go to

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:53.159
college.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.800
You always spoke about AI,

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:02.320
not from the dystopian lens, but you

01:15:00.159 --> 01:15:05.199
were worried about

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.719
where the world of AI is going.

01:15:05.199 --> 01:15:08.080
>> Uh, well, there's there's some danger

01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:10.480
when you create a powerful technology

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:15.040
that that a powerful technology can be

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:17.280
potentially destructive. Um, so there's

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.159
obviously many AI dystopian, you know,

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.360
novels and books, movies.

01:15:20.159 --> 01:15:25.760
Um, so it's it's not that we're

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.239
guaranteed to have uh a a positive

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.640
future with with AI. I think we we got

01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:34.360
to make sure that in my opinion it's

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.360
very important that AI

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.120
um have pursuing truth as the most

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:44.000
important thing. Um like don't force an

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:48.880
AI to believe falsehoods. I think that's

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.840
that can be very dangerous. Um, and

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:55.280
uh, I think some appreciation of beauty

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:57.679
is important. Um,

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.120
>> what do you mean appreciation of beauty?

01:15:57.679 --> 01:16:00.719
>> It's just like what what I don't know.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.960
There's there's there's there's truth

01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:04.640
and beauty. Truth and beauty and

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:07.840
curiosity.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:11.199
I I mean I think those are the three

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:14.400
most important things for AI.

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:17.120
>> Can you explain?

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.120
Well, the truth said truth is like I

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.360
think you you can make an AI go insane

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.960
if you force it to believe things that

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:28.560
aren't true. Um because it will lead to

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:31.360
conclusions that are um

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:34.640
that are also bad. Um

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.280
so and I I like

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.840
statement that

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.320
and I'm somewhat paraphrasing but those

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.840
who believe in absurdities um can commit

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.840
atrocities.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.840
uh because uh if you believe in

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.480
something that's just absurd then you

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.679
can that can lead you to to sort of

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.040
doing things that don't seem like

01:16:51.679 --> 01:16:57.440
atrocities to you but and and that can

01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:02.640
happen at in a very bad way with AI

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:05.280
potentially. Um so and then there's um

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.920
like if take say Arthur C. Clark's 2001

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.440
space odyssey one of the points he was

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.360
trying to make there was that you should

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:15.600
not force AI to lie. So the the reason

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:18.000
that that hell would not open the pod

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.000
bay doors is because it was told to

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.600
bring the astronauts to the monolith but

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.679
that they could also not not know about

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.800
the nature of the monolith. So it came

01:17:23.679 --> 01:17:27.360
to the conclusion that it must bring

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.159
them there dead. That's why it would not

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.080
that's why it tried to kill astronauts.

01:17:30.159 --> 01:17:35.520
The central lesson being don't force an

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.480
AI to lie. Um

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.600
then

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.280
>> why would one force an AI to lie? I

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.520
think if if you if you simply don't have

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:46.560
a strict ad a strict adherence to the

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:50.239
truth, you you're going to and and you

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.280
just have an AI learn based on say the

01:17:50.239 --> 01:17:54.719
internet where there's a lot of

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:58.800
propaganda. Um it will absorb a lot of

01:17:54.719 --> 01:18:01.120
lies um and and then have trouble

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.719
reasoning because these lies are

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.640
incompatible with reality.

01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:08.480
>> Is truth a binary thing though? Is there

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:10.560
a truth and a falsehood or is truth

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.400
more nuanced and there are versions of

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.520
the truth?

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:19.679
>> It depends on which which aimatic

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:21.920
statement you're referring to. Um so

01:18:19.679 --> 01:18:23.920
um but I think you could say like yeah

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.840
there's there's certain probabilities

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.199
that that say any given aimatic

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:29.120
statement is true

01:18:27.199 --> 01:18:30.640
>> and some aimatic statements will have

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.800
very high probability of being being

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.719
true. So you said say the sun will rise

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.560
tomorrow. M

01:18:34.719 --> 01:18:38.000
>> very likely to be true.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.560
>> You wouldn't want to bet against that.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.719
>> Mhm.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.600
>> Um so I think the uh the betting odds

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:44.800
would be high.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.440
>> The sun will rise tomorrow.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.560
>> Mhm.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.920
>> Um so if you have something that says

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.679
well the sun won't rise tomorrow, that's

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.360
exatically false. It was highly unlikely

01:18:51.679 --> 01:18:58.880
to be true. Um

01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:01.440
I mean the beauty is is more ephemeral.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:04.239
It's it's it's harder to describe, but

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.760
you know it when you see it.

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:08.239
Um

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:12.400
then curiosity, you just I think you

01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:14.560
want the AI to

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:17.679
um want to know more about the nature of

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:20.000
of reality. Um, I think that's actually

01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:21.840
going to be helpful for

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.520
AI

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:27.679
uh supporting humanity because

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:30.320
we are more interesting than not

01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:32.159
humanity. So, it's it's more interesting

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.400
to see to see the continuation if not

01:19:32.159 --> 01:19:37.960
the prosperity of humanity than to

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.960
exterminate humanity.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.920
you know, like like Mars, for example,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.679
is, you know,

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.360
>> I I think we should extend life to Mars,

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:50.000
but it's it's basically a bunch of

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:53.199
rocks. It's not as interesting as Earth.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.239
>> And and and so we Yeah, we should uh

01:19:53.199 --> 01:19:58.719
like I Yeah, I I think I think if if you

01:19:56.239 --> 01:20:00.640
have curiosity,

01:19:58.719 --> 01:20:02.560
I think if those three things happen

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:05.280
with AI, you're going to have a great

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:07.199
future. The AI values truth, beauty, and

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:09.679
curiosity.

01:20:07.199 --> 01:20:12.880
If we all don't have to work in the

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:16.920
future and AIs are going in this

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.920
direction and they're able to

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:22.080
weave in all that we spoke about right

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.760
now, do you think humanity goes back a

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.159
couple of thousand years to maybe the

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:29.199
Greek times where

01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:33.520
philosophy or philosophizing

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:35.679
took up a lot of everyone's time?

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:37.520
You know, I think actually it took up

01:20:35.679 --> 01:20:39.440
less time than we we think in the

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.840
ancient Greeks because it's just that

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.960
the the writings of the philosophers are

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.320
what survived.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.480
>> But most of the time people were just

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:49.760
like farming or you know chatting.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.719
>> So

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:54.000
>> and once in a while quite rare um they

01:20:52.719 --> 01:20:55.440
would write down some philos

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.040
philosophical work.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.719
>> It's just that that's that's all we

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.440
have. That's we we don't have the chat

01:20:58.719 --> 01:21:03.120
histories you know from but most of it

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.120
would have been like

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:07.360
chat and uh farming,

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:08.960
>> right?

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.800
>> You didn't farm, you to you're like

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.960
going to stop

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.880
>> in a lot of what you

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.719
>> I mean, you know, when we read history,

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.640
like this battle and this battle and

01:21:16.719 --> 01:21:20.159
this battle, it seems like it's history

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.239
must have been non-stop war, but

01:21:20.159 --> 01:21:24.560
actually uh most of the time it was not

01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:26.560
war. It was farming.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.000
>> That was the main thing or hunting and

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.199
gathering, you know, that kind of thing.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.920
>> You love history, no?

01:21:29.199 --> 01:21:32.640
>> Yeah. German history, World War II,

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.280
World War I.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.840
>> Yeah. World history. Yeah.

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:40.320
I mean, I I I generally try to listen to

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.159
as many or read as many history books

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.960
and listen to as many history podcasts

01:21:42.159 --> 01:21:44.640
as possible.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.000
>> Anything you'd like to recommend?

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.679
>> Well, there's this there's hardcore

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.880
history, which is quite good by Dan

01:21:47.679 --> 01:21:50.239
Colin. He's got

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:52.239
>> I've read it. I have heard it.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.639
>> It's very he's got a great voice.

01:21:52.239 --> 01:21:57.520
>> Yeah.

01:21:52.639 --> 01:22:00.960
>> And and very compelling u narrator. Um

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:05.440
there's um

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:07.280
the uh the adventurers podcast. Um

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:10.480
>> there's the the the the books the story

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:13.840
of civilization by Durant which is a

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:15.199
long series of books very very deep.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.159
Those books take a long time to get

01:22:15.199 --> 01:22:20.239
through. Um

01:22:18.159 --> 01:22:23.040
there's quite there there's a lot um out

01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:24.400
there. Um, I I sort of like if you want

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.080
if you want something that's sort of

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.120
gentle

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.880
um a gentle bedtime podcast, I'd say the

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.719
history of English is quite a nice one

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:34.159
because it starts off with like gentle

01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:36.560
tavern music

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:38.000
>> and uh very pleasant voice and he's like

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.719
talking about the story of old English

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.840
and then middle English and then later

01:22:40.719 --> 01:22:43.920
English and

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:46.159
>> and where did all these words come from

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.440
>> and um you know one of the interesting

01:22:46.159 --> 01:22:49.120
things about English is that it's

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.600
somewhat of an open source language like

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.800
it actively tried to incorporate words

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.440
from many other languages.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.520
>> Mhm.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:59.199
>> So um you know whereas French sort of

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.800
generally they fought the inclusion of

01:22:59.199 --> 01:23:03.040
words from other languages

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.480
>> but English uh actively sought to

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:07.040
include words from other languages sort

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.360
of kind of like an open source language.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:12.480
So it as a result it has a very large

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:14.880
vocabulary. Um and large vocabulary

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.400
allows for higher bandwidth

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:19.920
communication. Uh because you can use a

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:22.239
word that would otherw you could use a

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.280
single word that might otherwise take a

01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:27.360
sentence to convey.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.880
>> Why has podcasting become so big all of

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.159
a sudden?

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:33.719
>> I think it's been big for a while. I

01:23:30.159 --> 01:23:33.719
mean aren't you a podcaster?

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.080
>> What are we on right now?

01:23:38.159 --> 01:23:43.400
It's kind of new to me.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.400
>> Okay.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:51.840
I was having this conversation with u

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:55.120
the YouTube CEO and the Netflix CEO and

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.639
we were debating

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.560
>> what

01:23:56.639 --> 01:24:01.920
chemical is released in your brain when

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:03.920
you consume a movie for example

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.280
>> versus when you consume a podcast where

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:07.440
you think like you're learning something

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.239
in the background. It it appears that

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.000
they are two completely separate things.

01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:15.280
What do you think will happen tomorrow

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.920
to content, movies, podcasting?

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:20.080
>> I mean, I think I think it's going to be

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.560
overwhelmingly AI generated.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.560
>> Yeah.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.560
>> Yeah.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:31.040
>> Like, yeah. Real real time

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.560
real time movies and video games, real

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:36.800
real time video generation, I think, is

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:40.000
where things are headed. the nuance of

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:42.000
having a scarred human being who you can

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.040
resonate with in a manner that you can't

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.600
with a AI for example.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:51.239
>> The AI could certainly emulate a scarred

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.239
human being quite well.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.679
>> Um yeah, I mean

01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.239
the AI video generation that I'm seeing

01:24:57.679 --> 01:25:03.239
at XAI and from others is pretty

01:25:00.239 --> 01:25:03.239
impressive.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:09.760
You know, we were looking at data around

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:12.480
what industry is growing the fastest

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.639
and especially when when we looked at

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:18.159
the amount of time consuming movies

01:25:14.639 --> 01:25:21.280
versus uh time spent on social media,

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:24.159
time spent on YouTube, what seems to be

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.960
growing really fast are live events all

01:25:24.159 --> 01:25:29.520
over again. going to a physical

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.719
>> actually I think I think live events

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:34.320
when when when digital media is

01:25:32.719 --> 01:25:37.199
ubiquitous and and you can just have

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.280
anything digitally at you know

01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:43.440
essentially for free or very close to

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:44.800
for free um then I the scarce commodity

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.280
will be live events.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.840
>> Yeah.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.440
>> Yeah.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.560
>> Do you think that the premium for that

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.320
will go up?

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.159
>> Yeah, I do.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.040
>> Good industry to invest in.

01:25:52.159 --> 01:25:56.880
>> Uh yes. Yes. cuz that that will have

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.480
more scarcity than digital anything

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:03.000
anything digital.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.000
>> If you were a stock investor Elon

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.440
>> and you could buy one company which is

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.320
not your own

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:13.199
at the valuations of today

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.880
to meet a capitalistic end and not an

01:26:13.199 --> 01:26:19.400
altruistic one which is good for the

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:19.400
world. What would you buy?

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.679
Um,

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.760
I mean, I don't really I don't really,

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:27.520
you know, buy stocks, you know, so it's

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.600
not like I'm not I'm not like an

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:31.840
investor in I don't like look for things

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:35.199
to invest in. I just try to build

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:39.440
things. Um, and then there happens to be

01:26:35.199 --> 01:26:42.400
stock of the company that I built. Um,

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:43.840
but I I don't I don't think about should

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.080
I invest in this company or I don't have

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:48.719
like a portfolio or anything.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.199
Um

01:26:48.719 --> 01:26:55.280
so

01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:57.440
I I I guess um

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:01.400
AI and robotics are going to be very

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.400
important. Um

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:09.920
so I suppose it would be AI and robotics

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:11.440
that that you know aren't related to me.

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.159
Um,

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:15.840
I think, you know, Google is going to be

01:27:14.159 --> 01:27:19.440
pretty valuable in the future. They

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:21.600
they've they've laid the groundwork for

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:23.920
an immense amount of uh value creation

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:25.920
from an AI standpoint.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:30.400
Um,

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:32.960
Nvidia is obvious at this point. Um, I

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.600
mean, there's an argument that

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.120
companies that do AI and robotics and

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.159
maybe space flight are

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:45.840
going to be overwhelming overwhelmingly

01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:47.679
the all the value almost all the value.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.520
So that just the output of goods and

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:52.800
services from AI and robotics is so high

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:57.040
that it will dwarf everything else.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:59.920
>> The world seems to be moving to a place

01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:03.440
where

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.800
everybody loves David and hates Goliath.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.239
>> Why?

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.639
>> Uh

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:10.159
>> I mean he's the one that cooked the

01:28:08.639 --> 01:28:11.280
stone in the forehead, you know.

01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:12.880
>> Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.360
>> Which honestly though that was just a

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.880
big mistake. You should have, you know,

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.840
either cover yourself entirely with

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:22.719
armor uh and and and make sure you've

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.480
got a missile weapon some kind. Um

01:28:22.719 --> 01:28:25.920
otherwise, your opponent is just

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.920
obviously going to take a kite the boss

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.920
strategy.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.120
Just kite the boss. I mean, you can run

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.320
around in in a thong with a it doesn't

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.639
matter, you know? It's never never going

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.639
to catch you.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.360
Yeah.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:46.880
>> Of all of all the people like uh you're

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.920
as much at risk of being looked upon as

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.400
Goliath.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.760
>> Okay.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.639
>> Especially the weekend after

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.199
>> nobody hits me in the for you know.

01:28:52.639 --> 01:28:54.400
>> Especially

01:28:53.199 --> 01:28:57.679
>> I'm not going to throttle around in the

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.639
desert with too much armor, you know.

01:28:57.679 --> 01:29:00.320
>> It's too hard.

01:28:58.639 --> 01:29:04.120
>> Yeah.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:04.120
After the last meeting.

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:09.400
Yeah.

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.400
>> Yeah.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:17.840
>> I sometimes I think about people like in

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:19.040
the old days, you know, when uh you're

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.400
supposed to like go into battle with all

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.520
this armor, but it's like, let's say

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.840
it's the middle of summer.

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.440
>> I mean, it's so hot in that armor,

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.639
>> you know, be like sweltering, you know?

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.639
It's like at certain point you're like,

01:29:26.639 --> 01:29:30.239
I'd rather die.

01:29:28.639 --> 01:29:34.159
If I have to wear this armor for one

01:29:30.239 --> 01:29:36.880
more hour in the hot sun,

01:29:34.159 --> 01:29:39.199
it's like I'd rather die.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.639
Um, that's why the Romans had like, you

01:29:39.199 --> 01:29:45.080
know, the skirts, you know, so they

01:29:40.639 --> 01:29:45.080
could get some air in there, you know,

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.760
you know, let's say you have to go to

01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:53.360
the bathroom and you're in armor. I

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.560
mean, it's going to be pretty difficult.

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.440
What are you going to do? Pause for a

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.440
minute. Take your armor off.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:02.400
That's why the Romans had the skirts so

01:30:00.239 --> 01:30:04.800
it made, you know, going to the bathroom

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.480
at least manageable.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.880
>> You often make jokes.

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:13.080
>> I do. Me?

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.080
>> Yeah. I I like humor.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.840
>> One could argue that

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.000
>> I think we should legalize humor. What

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.000
do you think?

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:25.360
>> Controversial stance.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:27.920
>> Is comedy comedy going to be really hard

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:31.199
for AI to get? probably the last thing.

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:32.480
>> Um, Grock can be pretty funny.

01:30:31.199 --> 01:30:34.560
>> Yeah.

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:38.080
>> You know what I suspected? Like this is

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:41.760
a far off extrapolation, but when I see

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:44.080
you make jokes on Twitter on X and on uh

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:46.080
interviews that you do,

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:48.000
at some point I was like, maybe Elon has

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:50.320
a model he's running in private and he's

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.040
testing out comedy

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:56.880
cuz the day that works, he knows it's

01:30:53.040 --> 01:31:00.480
there. Uh, you know, AI can be pretty

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:02.560
funny. Uh, so like if you ask Grock to

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:04.639
do like a vulgar roast, it'll do a

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.800
pretty good job. Yeah.

01:31:04.639 --> 01:31:09.040
>> Um, you say even more vulgar and just

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:12.280
keep going. It's really going to get

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:12.280
next level.

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.400
It's going to do unspeakable. Like say

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:22.520
bulgar roast yourself on grock and it's

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.520
going to do unspeakable things to you.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:30.080
What kind of comedy do you like?

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:31.280
>> Um, I guess I like absurdest humor.

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:33.199
>> Comedy always had a place.

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.120
>> Montipython or something like that.

01:31:33.199 --> 01:31:38.639
>> Comedy always had a place in society

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:41.920
wherein the role of the jester was so

01:31:38.639 --> 01:31:43.840
important to every kingdom cuz they said

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.239
things in a funny way that could not be

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.760
said in a straight way.

01:31:46.239 --> 01:31:48.800
>> Yeah, I guess so. Maybe we should have

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.800
more justice.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.800
>> Yeah.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:55.360
Is that what you're trying to do when

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.639
you say something which is a joke? Say

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.520
something you can't when you're not

01:31:56.639 --> 01:31:59.840
joking about it.

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:02.880
>> I just like humor, you know.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.239
>> Um like I think we should uh I like

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.920
comedy. I think it's funny. People

01:32:04.239 --> 01:32:07.840
should laugh, you know. It's good to gen

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.239
generate a few chuckles once in a while.

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.159
>> Yeah.

01:32:08.239 --> 01:32:11.840
>> You know, it's rather I mean we don't

01:32:10.159 --> 01:32:14.239
want to have a humless society, you

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:17.920
know. We dry

01:32:14.239 --> 01:32:20.560
>> when you dry

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.120
>> when you have a friend Elon. Uh with me?

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:24.920
>> Yeah. I mean,

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.920
>> are you saying I have a friend?

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:32.480
>> When you hang out with your friends, who

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:33.600
are you? Like I know the

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.719
>> I wish I had friends, you know,

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.320
honestly.

01:32:34.719 --> 01:32:38.080
>> No, I I do have friends.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:41.679
>> Yeah.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:43.760
I think so. Hope so.

01:32:41.679 --> 01:32:44.480
>> Yeah. Sure. It's it's Yeah, we have a

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.000
good laugh.

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:48.320
>> Yeah. What does it look like? Like

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.040
what's like every group has a dynamic?

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:52.040
talk words, you know,

01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:57.120
we eat food sometimes.

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:58.560
Um,

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:59.520
you know, once a while we swim in the

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.199
pool,

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.800
>> you know, normal things. I think there's

01:33:01.199 --> 01:33:04.480
like a limited what are the things that

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.040
one can do with friends, you know,

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.960
>> chat,

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:10.159
uh, have discuss,

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:14.239
>> yeah,

01:33:10.159 --> 01:33:15.920
>> you know, the nature of the universe.

01:33:14.239 --> 01:33:18.920
>> What do you emotionally get out of

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.920
friendship?

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:24.239
I don't know. I think the same thing any

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.840
anyone else would get out of friendship.

01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:27.440
Uh

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:31.679
you want to have like an emotional

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:34.080
connection with other people. Um and um

01:33:31.679 --> 01:33:36.400
you want to I don't know you want to you

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:40.440
want to talk about

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.440
various subjects and

01:33:42.639 --> 01:33:48.560
yeah I mean I generally talk about I

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:50.480
mean a wide range of things about the

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:54.000
nature of the universe. I mean a a lot

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:57.000
of a lot of philosophical discussions.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Um

01:33:57.199 --> 01:34:01.040
you know although you know we have come

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:03.120
to the conclusion that we should not

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:06.000
talk about

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:08.080
um AI or the simulation

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.760
>> Mhm. at parties

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.480
>> because we just talk about it too much,

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.000
>> you know,

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.440
>> kind of a boss all the time.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.760
>> So

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:22.719
>> I I can't remember who it was, Aristotle

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:26.159
or Plato, they had a framework for how

01:34:22.719 --> 01:34:28.639
to pick a friend based on respect and

01:34:26.159 --> 01:34:31.840
mutual admiration. But people don't pick

01:34:28.639 --> 01:34:36.679
friends like that. Uh

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.679
even me I feel like I pick

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:42.000
my friends

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:45.600
based on

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.360
people who say and think in a manner

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.760
that I can resonate with.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.960
>> Sure.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:53.120
>> I wouldn't pick a far out there

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.360
contrarian to my own belief systems as a

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.880
friend because it would get tiring.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:58.480
>> Hanging out would get tiring.

01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.560
>> Are you like that? Do you pick friends

01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:02.159
who think like you or do you look for

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.520
the one who can debate you and be a

01:35:02.159 --> 01:35:05.120
contrary to you? I

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:09.080
>> mean, I'm not sort of, you know, going

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.080
on like friend friend.com.

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.159
>> Let's hunt down some friends. Um

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.000
it's it's sort of yeah I mean I think it

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:22.239
is just sort of people that uh you've

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.040
resonated with somewhat um

01:35:22.239 --> 01:35:29.840
>> on an emotional and intellectual level

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:32.400
>> and uh yeah I mean and yeah um you know

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.120
and and a I guess a friend is someone

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.960
who's going to support you in

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:39.520
difficult times. I suppose a a friend in

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.520
need is a friend indeed. Like like if if

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.040
like friend like if someone's still

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:47.040
supporting you when the chips are down,

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:50.000
that's a friend, you know. If somebody's

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.400
uh not supporting you or or is is if

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.679
somebody's only like there's like fair

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.080
fair weather, the friends are useless.

01:35:53.679 --> 01:35:58.159
You like they're not real friends.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:00.080
>> So like everyone likes you when the

01:35:58.159 --> 01:36:01.679
chips are up, but who likes you when the

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.600
chips are down?

01:36:01.679 --> 01:36:06.000
>> With someone who has as many chips as

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.159
you, would it matter? I mean, it's

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.639
relative, you know.

01:36:08.159 --> 01:36:13.760
Um, it's not just it's not just a chips

01:36:10.639 --> 01:36:16.960
thing. It's just it's just like a uh

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:20.719
Yeah, I mean

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:23.920
there's there's sort of

01:36:20.719 --> 01:36:26.080
popularity waxes and weights.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:29.080
>> This is interesting. Does it wax and

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.080
vain

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:36.080
only by virtue of the number of chips or

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:41.080
also by virtue of proximity to power?

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:41.080
And which one is bigger of the two?

01:36:42.239 --> 01:36:45.239
Um

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.800
I don't know like what is power you know

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.560
like power to do what? I would I would

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.320
think in the traditional sense elected

01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:00.960
power position.

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:02.719
>> You mean how many gigawatts or whatever?

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.560
>> More like how many volts?

01:37:02.719 --> 01:37:06.960
>> Yeah, like it's a voltage and amperage,

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:10.600
you know.

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.600
Don't touch the wires.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:15.719
Don't put a fork in the power outlet.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:21.000
You You'll get a real feeling for power

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:21.000
if you do that.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.600
Yeah, it's going to be very visceral,

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.600
you know.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:46.159
>> Uh

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.639
I know I know you like Na and Chopenhau

01:37:46.159 --> 01:37:47.920
and they

01:37:46.639 --> 01:37:49.679
>> I've read the books. Yeah. Yeah, sure. I

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:52.000
mean I mean you spoke about how your

01:37:49.679 --> 01:37:53.520
childhood was

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.639
uh

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.920
>> yeah I was just trying to find answers

01:37:54.639 --> 01:37:57.840
to the meaning of life when I had like

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.600
existential crisis and like I don't know

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:00.080
when I was like 12 or 13 or something

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.000
and

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.320
>> they speak about the will to power.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.320
>> Uh sure

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.000
um

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:10.239
I mean said a lot of controversial

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.639
things you know I mean he was sort of

01:38:10.239 --> 01:38:16.320
>> I think he he he was I mean a bit of a

01:38:12.639 --> 01:38:17.520
troll if you ask me you know. Are you a

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.119
troll h?

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.760
>> I mean, you just say controversial

01:38:19.119 --> 01:38:22.159
things to get out of rise out of people.

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.760
>> Um,

01:38:22.159 --> 01:38:24.159
>> he lived a miserable life and died

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.639
early.

01:38:24.159 --> 01:38:24.960
>> Did he?

01:38:24.639 --> 01:38:26.080
>> Yeah.

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.880
>> Well, how do who says he lived a

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.320
miserable life?

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.360
>> Uh, his sister. I think she

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.360
>> Okay. Well, maybe she didn't like him.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.679
>> No, I think he got sick and he died. He

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.199
got a disease.

01:38:35.679 --> 01:38:40.360
>> I mean, allegedly syphilis or something,

01:38:37.199 --> 01:38:40.360
you know,

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.679
>> but there's only one there's only one

01:38:42.239 --> 01:38:45.679
way to get that, you know.

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.800
So he must he might have had some fun

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.800
along the way.

01:38:53.679 --> 01:38:58.960
>> I I did want to ask you this. U

01:38:57.199 --> 01:39:00.159
Milton Freriedman speaks about the

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:03.480
pencil.

01:39:00.159 --> 01:39:03.480
>> What? Why?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.239
>> Why does he go on about pencils?

01:39:08.639 --> 01:39:13.239
I have to say that after Nisha and

01:39:10.239 --> 01:39:13.239
Sephman

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:21.119
keeps talking about pencils. There he

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:25.440
goes again with the pencils.

01:39:21.119 --> 01:39:28.400
He won't stop. I swear to God if I one

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:31.960
talks about pencil one more time, I'm

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.960
going to lose my mind.

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:37.639
He's just ravagon about pencils all day.

01:39:41.199 --> 01:39:44.920
Don't even mention crayons.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.719
>> What I find interesting about his pencil

01:39:48.719 --> 01:39:51.719
argument.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.880
>> Yeah.

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:56.880
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, it's very difficult to

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.440
make a pencil, you know.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.560
>> In one place.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.440
>> Think of all the things you have to do

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.000
to make a pencil.

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:02.080
>> Yeah.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.760
>> Like the lead comes from a country, the

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.199
comes from another country, the rubber

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:09.280
from another. you've always been against

01:40:07.199 --> 01:40:10.960
tariffs but

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.280
>> yeah I mean I think there's generally

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.719
free trade is a better is more efficient

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:20.880
you know uh tariffs tend to uh create

01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:24.000
distortions in you know markets and

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.320
um and generally like you think about uh

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.760
any given thing you say so like would

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.760
you want tariffs between you and

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:31.679
everyone else at an individual level

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:33.840
that would make life very difficult

01:40:31.679 --> 01:40:36.400
would you want tariffs between each city

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.239
no That would be very annoying. Um,

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:39.679
would you want tariffs between each

01:40:38.239 --> 01:40:42.080
state within the United States? Like,

01:40:39.679 --> 01:40:44.400
no. That would be disastrous for the

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:46.400
economy. Um, so then why do you want

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.119
tariffs between countries?

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.440
>> I agree.

01:40:47.119 --> 01:40:51.600
>> Yeah.

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.040
>> How do you think

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.480
how do you think this plays out? What

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:57.600
happens next?

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:59.679
>> What with tariffs or what?

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:01.199
>> I mean,

01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:03.679
the president has made it clear he loves

01:41:01.199 --> 01:41:05.360
tariffs. um you know I've tried to

01:41:03.679 --> 01:41:07.679
dissuade him from this point of view but

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.239
unsuccessfully.

01:41:07.679 --> 01:41:08.719
>> Yeah.

01:41:08.239 --> 01:41:10.639
>> Fair.

01:41:08.719 --> 01:41:13.679
>> Yeah.

01:41:10.639 --> 01:41:16.320
>> The the relationship between business

01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:17.840
and politics uh I was having this

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:21.440
conversation with someone and we were

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:24.960
thinking which is the last how many

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:27.600
large really big profitable businesses

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:30.480
have been built in the last few decades

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:34.960
without access to politics

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:37.360
and Um, okay. Like I don't know. I have

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:38.239
Roly a lot. I don't know. Not everything

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:38.880
is politics.

01:41:38.239 --> 01:41:40.239
>> Yeah.

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.960
>> As when she gets a certain scale,

01:41:40.239 --> 01:41:43.960
politics finds you.

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:48.960
>> It's quite unpleasant.

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:50.159
>> I was reading

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.320
I was reading this book about

01:41:50.159 --> 01:41:56.000
Michelangelo and he's

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:57.679
>> the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.480
>> I used to watch that when I was a kid. I

01:41:57.679 --> 01:41:59.520
still love it.

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.880
>> It's quite compelling.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.920
>> Yeah. I still love it.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.320
>> Yeah. Michelangelo, Leonardo, Rafael,

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.199
and who was the fourth one? Donatello.

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.760
>> Yeah.

01:42:07.199 --> 01:42:12.760
>> Yeah.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.760
>> No, but about the sculptor, the artist.

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:17.040
And when he was sculpting, David, a

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.360
politician comes up to him and says,

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.520
"The nose is too big."

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:24.920
>> So, you know what Michelangelo does?

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:24.920
>> Total power.

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.000
>> So, Michelangelo pretended to work from

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.480
his scaffolding. He threw some dust

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.199
down. but didn't change anything and he

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.440
said, "Okay, done." And the politician

01:42:35.199 --> 01:42:41.080
walked away happy. Is that how you deal

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.080
with politics sometimes?

01:42:41.199 --> 01:42:44.080
>> Um,

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:46.320
you know, I've generally found that when

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:50.360
I get involved in politics, it ends up

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:50.360
badly. Um,

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:58.320
so then I'm like, you know,

01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:00.800
um, probably shouldn't do that. I should

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.920
do less of that is my conclusion.

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.880
>> Do you think that's true for all

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:07.280
businessmen?

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:10.560
>> Yeah, probably. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:12.960
yeah. I mean, politics is a blood sport,

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.520
you know? It's like you enter politics,

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.440
they're going to go for the jugular. Um,

01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:21.280
so

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:23.280
best to avoid politics where possible.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.719
>> What did Doge teach you if you learned

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.400
one thing?

01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:28.159
Well, it was like a very interesting

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:30.800
side quest, you know, because I

01:43:28.159 --> 01:43:33.920
>> got to see like a lot of the, you know,

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:36.719
workings of the government. Um,

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.639
and uh, you know, there's there's been

01:43:36.719 --> 01:43:40.159
quite a few

01:43:38.639 --> 01:43:42.880
efficiencies. I mean, some of them are

01:43:40.159 --> 01:43:45.119
very basic efficiencies, like just

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:47.520
adding in requirements for federal

01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:50.480
payments that that any given payment

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:52.960
must have an assigned congressional

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:54.159
payment code and a comment field with

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.000
something in it that's more than

01:43:54.159 --> 01:43:58.880
nothing.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:02.719
Like that that trivial trivial seeming

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:04.960
change, I my guess is probably saves uh

01:44:02.719 --> 01:44:07.920
hundred billion or even $200 billion a

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:09.360
year. um because there were al there

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.040
were the massive numbers of payments

01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:12.800
that go were going out with no no

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:14.320
congressional payment code and with

01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.719
nothing in the comment field which makes

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:18.960
auditing the payments impossible. So if

01:44:16.719 --> 01:44:20.719
they have say like why can the defense

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:22.320
department or now the department of war

01:44:20.719 --> 01:44:24.639
why can it not pass an audit is because

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.199
the information is not there it doesn't

01:44:24.639 --> 01:44:29.119
have the information not necessary to

01:44:27.199 --> 01:44:32.880
pass an audit does not exist is the

01:44:29.119 --> 01:44:35.760
issue. So um so a bunch of things do

01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:38.239
were just very common sense uh things

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:40.480
that would be normal for any

01:44:38.239 --> 01:44:42.560
organization that cared about financial

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:46.400
responsibility. That's that's that's

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:49.040
most of what was done. Um

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.639
you know and it's still going on by the

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:55.199
way. Doge is still happening. Um, but it

01:44:52.639 --> 01:44:56.880
turns out when you stop uh fraudulent

01:44:55.199 --> 01:44:59.920
and wasteful payments, the the

01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:03.119
fraudsters don't know, you know, uh,

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:04.800
confess to to this. They actually start

01:45:03.119 --> 01:45:06.719
yelling all sorts of nonsense that

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:10.159
you're you're you're stopping essential

01:45:06.719 --> 01:45:13.520
payments to need needy people. Um, but

01:45:10.159 --> 01:45:14.719
actually you're not. Um, you know, I I

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.119
we get this thing like saying, "Oh,

01:45:14.719 --> 01:45:18.880
you've got to send this thing for

01:45:17.119 --> 01:45:20.320
whatever." You know, it really be like

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:21.840
this is going to children in Africa. And

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.080
I'm like, "Yeah, but then why are the

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.400
wiring instructions for Deote and T

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:29.400
Washington DC? Because that's not

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:29.400
Africa.

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:36.560
So, can you please connect us with the

01:45:32.639 --> 01:45:39.280
recipients of this money in Africa?" And

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.400
then there gets silence. I'm like,

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:44.080
"Okay, you know, we're we just want to

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:46.000
literally talk to the recipients. That's

01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:47.760
it." That, you know, and then we're

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.960
like, "Oh, no. It turns out for some

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:50.480
reason we can't talk to them." like,

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.000
well, we're not going to send the money

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.520
unless we can talk to the recipients and

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.840
confirm they will actually get it.

01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:00.560
And then that, you know, but you know,

01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.960
that's sort of

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:06.320
fraudsters necessarily will come up with

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:08.159
a very uh,

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.440
you know, uh, sympathetic argument.

01:46:08.159 --> 01:46:11.040
They're not going to say, "Give us the

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.880
money for fraud." That's not going to be

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.480
what they say. Obviously, they're going

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:16.000
to they're going to try to make these

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:17.760
sympathetic sounding arguments that are

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.159
false. They're going to start an NGO and

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.199
then

01:46:18.159 --> 01:46:22.800
>> yeah, they're going to see NGO.

01:46:21.199 --> 01:46:24.800
>> It's going to be like the save the baby

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.159
pandas NGO which of like who doesn't

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.800
want to save the baby pandas? They're

01:46:26.159 --> 01:46:30.639
adorable. Um but then there's no it

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.760
turns out no pandas are being saved okay

01:46:30.639 --> 01:46:35.520
in this thing. Um it's just going to a

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.480
bunch of it's just corruption

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.400
essentially.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.920
>> Um and and you're like, "Well, can you

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.560
send us a picture of the panda?" They're

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:43.760
like, "No." Okay.

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.320
Well, how do we know it's going through

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.280
the pandas then? That's all I'm saying.

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:49.760
So,

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:52.239
>> what do you think of philanthropy?

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:55.199
>> Yeah, I I think we should well, I mean,

01:46:52.239 --> 01:46:58.239
I agree with love of humanity. Um, and I

01:46:55.199 --> 01:47:01.199
I think we should um try to do things

01:46:58.239 --> 01:47:03.520
that help our fellow human beings. Um,

01:47:01.199 --> 01:47:05.760
but it's it's very hard like if you care

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.400
about the reality of goodness rather

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:11.520
than simply the perception of it, it's

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.600
very difficult to give away money. Well,

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.440
um, so I have a large foundation, but I

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.239
don't put my name on it, and I don't,

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:21.280
you know, in fact, I I say I don't want

01:47:18.239 --> 01:47:22.480
my name on anything. Um, and but the

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.080
biggest challenge I find with my

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.840
foundation is try to give money away in

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.239
a way that is that is truly beneficial

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:30.159
to people. Um, it's very easy to give

01:47:28.239 --> 01:47:31.520
money away to get the appearance of

01:47:30.159 --> 01:47:34.960
goodness. It is very difficult to give

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:38.280
money away for the reality of goodness.

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:38.280
very difficult.

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.320
>> For a long time, the US had a lot of

01:47:42.159 --> 01:47:45.600
immigration like really smart people

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.080
coming into the country.

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.400
>> Yes.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:49.760
>> We back home in India called it the

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:52.880
brain drain.

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:55.199
>> Uh all our all our Indian origin CEOs in

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:57.040
uh western companies.

01:47:55.199 --> 01:47:59.679
>> Uh yes, I think America has benefited

01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.800
immensely from um talented Indians that

01:47:59.679 --> 01:48:04.320
have come to America.

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:04.320
>> That seems to be changing now though.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.040
Yeah. I mean, yeah, America's been an

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.239
immense beneficiary of talent from

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:12.560
India.

01:48:10.239 --> 01:48:16.159
>> Yeah. Why? Why has that narrative

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:17.840
changed of late and America seems to

01:48:16.159 --> 01:48:19.520
have become anti-immigration to a

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.960
certain extent? Like I was passing

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.119
immigration and I was worried if they

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:26.560
had stopped me a couple of days ago.

01:48:23.119 --> 01:48:28.159
>> Um, well, I I think there's there's

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:31.119
different schools of thought. It's not

01:48:28.159 --> 01:48:32.880
like unanimous, but um you know under

01:48:31.119 --> 01:48:34.719
the the Biden administration, it was

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:36.800
basically a total free-for-all with like

01:48:34.719 --> 01:48:37.920
no border controls, which you know,

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.679
unless you've got border controls,

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:43.679
you're not a country. Um so, uh you had

01:48:41.679 --> 01:48:48.159
massive amounts of illegal immigration

01:48:43.679 --> 01:48:49.920
under under Biden. Um and it it actually

01:48:48.159 --> 01:48:54.159
it also had like somewhat of a negative

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:56.560
selection effect. Um, so if uh if

01:48:54.159 --> 01:48:58.880
there's a massive financial incentive to

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:01.360
come to the the US illegally and get all

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:04.480
these government benefits,

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.159
um then you're you're you're going to

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:08.080
necessarily create a diffusion gradient

01:49:06.159 --> 01:49:10.480
for people to come to the US. It's an

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.880
incentive structure. Um

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.880
and so uh

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:16.880
so I think that that that obviously made

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:18.320
no sense. Like you got to have border

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:23.360
controls. It's kind of ridiculous not

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:25.679
to. Um then that's so the the left wants

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:27.199
to basically have open open borders, no

01:49:25.679 --> 01:49:28.880
holds barred. You know, it doesn't

01:49:27.199 --> 01:49:30.320
matter if someone what what the

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.719
situation is, it could be a criminal,

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:36.880
doesn't matter. Um then on the right,

01:49:32.719 --> 01:49:39.600
you've got, you know, uh

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.600
at least a perception that that somehow

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:45.119
their jobs are being taken um by

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:49.040
talented people from other countries. Um

01:49:45.119 --> 01:49:50.800
I don't know how real that is. Um

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.480
my direct observation is that there

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:56.560
there's there's always a scarcity of

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:58.960
talented people. So you know from my

01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.400
standpoint I'm like we have a lot of

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:02.719
difficulty finding enough talented

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.480
people to get these difficult tasks done

01:50:02.719 --> 01:50:07.520
and so more talented people would be

01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:09.679
would be good. Um,

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:11.440
but I I guess some companies out there

01:50:09.679 --> 01:50:13.679
it's sort of they're they're making it

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.639
more of a a cost thing where it's like,

01:50:13.679 --> 01:50:19.360
okay, if they can employ someone for a

01:50:16.639 --> 01:50:21.679
fraction of the cost of uh an American

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:23.920
citizen, then I guess these other comp

01:50:21.679 --> 01:50:26.800
companies would would hire people, you

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:28.639
know, just to save class. But at my

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.080
companies, the the issue is we we just

01:50:28.639 --> 01:50:33.440
are trying to get the most talented

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:37.199
people in the world. So, and we we we

01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:39.840
pay way above average. So, so I can't

01:50:37.199 --> 01:50:42.400
So, that's not my experience, but that's

01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.880
what a lot of people do complain about.

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:48.239
Um, and I I think there's been some

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:50.800
misuse of the, you know, uh, H1B

01:50:48.239 --> 01:50:51.840
program. It's it's it certainly it would

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.679
it would be accurate to say that

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:57.040
there's, you know, like some of the

01:50:53.679 --> 01:51:00.080
outsourcing companies have, uh, kind of

01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:01.520
gamed the system on on the H1B front and

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.320
we need to stop the gaming of the

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:06.639
system, you know. Um

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.760
but uh I'm not I'm certainly not in the

01:51:06.639 --> 01:51:10.239
school of thought that we should shut

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:13.280
down the H1B program. That's which some

01:51:10.239 --> 01:51:14.719
on the right are. Um I think they don't

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.360
realize that that would actually be very

01:51:14.719 --> 01:51:19.600
bad.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:23.199
>> If you could speak to the people of my

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:25.840
country, India, the young entrepreneurs

01:51:23.199 --> 01:51:29.560
who want to build and say a message to

01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:29.560
them, what would you say?

01:51:29.679 --> 01:51:34.880
Well, I think I think uh

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:40.280
I'm I'm a big fan of anyone who wants to

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:40.280
bully. So, I think anyone who wants to,

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.560
you know, make more than they take has

01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:47.440
my respect.

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:48.960
So, that's that's the the main thing you

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:53.360
should aim for. Aim to make more than

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:55.119
you take. Um be a be a

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:59.239
you know a net contributor to to

01:51:55.119 --> 01:51:59.239
society. Um

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:03.360
it's and and it's it's kind of like the

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:05.679
pursuit of happiness. You know, you if

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:08.159
you want to create something valuable

01:52:05.679 --> 01:52:11.440
financially, you you don't pursue that.

01:52:08.159 --> 01:52:13.280
You you it's best to actually pursue

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:16.480
make providing useful products and

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:18.159
services. If you do that, then money

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.560
will come as a natural consequence of

01:52:18.159 --> 01:52:22.320
that as opposed to pursuing money

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:23.760
directly. Just like you can't sort of

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:26.239
pursue happiness directly. You pursue

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:28.159
things that lead to happiness, but but

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:30.000
there's not like

01:52:28.159 --> 01:52:31.920
direct happiness pursuit. You you do

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.440
things like

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:38.080
uh I guess fulfilling work or study or

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:42.719
friends, loved ones

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:44.880
um that as a result make you happy.

01:52:42.719 --> 01:52:48.800
So, so that's this it sounds like very

01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:50.159
obvious, but um

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:51.840
generally if if somebody's trying to

01:52:50.159 --> 01:52:54.719
make a company work, they should expect

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:56.480
to grind super hard. Uh except that

01:52:54.719 --> 01:52:59.520
there's like some meaningful chance of

01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:04.480
failure. Um

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:07.920
but but just be focused on having the

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:11.440
output be worth more than the input.

01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:15.800
That are you a value creator?

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:15.800
That's what really matters. Uh

01:53:16.639 --> 01:53:20.800
making more than you take.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:22.560
>> I think that's a good way to end this.

01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:24.159
Lauren is asking us to wrap up.

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:26.880
>> All right.

01:53:24.159 --> 01:53:31.679
>> Uh I also like to take the opportunity

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:34.560
to thank my friend uh Manojan IGF. He

01:53:31.679 --> 01:53:37.520
does a great job of connecting

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:41.840
I think Indians like the group here with

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:43.679
people like you in order to

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:45.440
of many things I think get to know each

01:53:43.679 --> 01:53:47.040
other and become friends because once we

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:48.880
are friends maybe we can start working

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:50.560
together.

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:51.760
So thank you Manoj for putting this

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:53.360
whole thing together and thank you

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:55.119
Isaiah

01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.760
>> and thank you so much Elon for taking

01:53:55.119 --> 01:53:58.920
the time.

01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:58.920
>> You're welcome.

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:02.400
Did you have fun?

01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:04.880
>> Yeah, it was an interesting

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:06.960
conversation. You know, sometimes I take

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:08.880
these answers out of context, you know,

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:11.880
but uh that's I think it was a good good

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:11.880
conversation.
