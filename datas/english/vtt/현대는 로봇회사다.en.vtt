WEBVTT

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.720
So, I've got this video of Hyundai's

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.480
plant at HMG Metal Plant America up. How

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.639
about you tell us a little bit about

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.120
what you see in that plant and then

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.040
we'll get into why we need a generalist

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.039
for it. That's one of the many carb

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.520
manufacturing plants we've visited and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.840
HMGMA is one of the newest one. So, it

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.000
has the highest ratio of automation, but

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.240
despite that, once you visit it, you

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.480
realize that there's still many uh tasks

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.320
that are still for the most part done

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.239
manually. And the first thing that comes

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.960
to mind when you visit that plant is

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.200
that those tasks are on one hand very

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.040
hard, very complex. There's tons of

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.280
variability that comes with adapting

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.079
with the large variety of objects that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.280
go into assembling a car. Tons of very

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.920
dextrous tasks like using tools,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.079
assemblies, handling small parts. But if

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.520
you talk to manufacturing engineers,

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.360
they will tell you that the reason why

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.280
they're not automated is not because of

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.879
how complex they are. They have great

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.199
solutions, lots of technologies to

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.280
automate it. It's just it takes too much

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.840
space. It takes too much engineering,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.520
too much cost to automate each one of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.320
those. Uh there's just too many. There's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.680
thousands. So special purpose solution

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.960
for each one of them is just not

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.799
economically viable.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.600
>> So there's like the conventional

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.880
manufacturing automation world where if

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.759
you want to say bolt a wheel onto a car,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.520
you would commission a machine that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.360
bolts a wheel onto that car. And that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.400
machine probably has a general purpose

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.520
robot arm in it. But it's still like a

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.680
thing where you're going to write a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.920
specification. I want my wheelbolter

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.159
runner machine and a bunch of

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.840
manufacturing and automation engineers

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.400
are going to design that machine for

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.000
you, make a special end defector for

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.600
that arm and install it on the line.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.840
There's going to be a bolt vibratory

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.320
bolt feeder and all all the all the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.479
stuff.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.040
>> You're going to need tons of uh pro

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.000
specialized programming to make the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.000
machines work.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.840
>> Yep. Um and so like when you look at a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.200
car plant, we're looking at a bunch of

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.680
tasks from uh real Hyundai plants here.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.000
There's probably tens of thousands of

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.319
different tasks that need to be done in

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.280
that plant. And the thing that you

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.160
really rapidly get to is if you're going

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.959
to design automation for each of those

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.720
things, uh you'd be uh spending way more

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.640
than it's worth to automate those tasks

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.959
and you'd probably be well into the next

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.440
century. Yeah,

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.319
>> like an average estimate of like how

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.440
long it takes for any any one of those

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.480
um integration efforts um it's in the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.319
order of about a year and north of a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.080
million dollars for any step that you

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.440
want to automate. That's sort of the the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.519
state-of-the-art today.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.280
>> You you turn over the model year every

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.000
year. So you change a bunch of trim

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.000
parts, interior technology and stuff and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.319
then you do a major model line refresh

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.840
say every 5 years. So it's that

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.280
variability that really u puts a ceiling

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.920
to um like traditional automation right

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.920
how what the core question is how do we

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.319
make something that is more flexible

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.440
that provides uh at the degree of

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.319
generality so that you can automate

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.080
those tasks.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.800
>> Uh do you want to walk us through a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.959
little bit of a a map of kind of how

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.400
robotics was previously in the world

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.080
we're headed to?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.200
>> Yeah. Um so there's like a spectrum

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.280
right so classical robotics like four

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.480
years ago [laughter]

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.799
we build specialized models for as I

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.280
describing earlier for perception

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.599
specialized models for high level

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.879
coordination specialized models for

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.400
manipulation

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:50.319
>> even specialized models for mobility now

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.239
we've agreed that maintaining and uh

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.920
evolving all of those models with all

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.959
that complexity is not a scalable

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.680
process.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.439
>> On the other end, you have a fully end

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.680
to-end solution where robots ingest

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.519
pixels uh or row information from

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.680
sensors and at the output you produce

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.480
torqus or currents that go to the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.040
actuators.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.519
>> Yeah,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.479
>> we know how to train uh these more

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.639
abstract systems through expedience. The

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.199
complexity is the scale of data that is

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.440
necessary, right? And like LLMs today

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:29.440
are a perfect example. If you have

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.759
enough data um you can rely on uh raw

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.919
representations like not just LLMs but

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.720
like video model prediction

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.280
>> uh systems right you can rely on raw

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.199
representations to train really highly

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.280
performance systems what's the degree in

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.680
between where an actual practical

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.160
solution is going to land on uh for

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.560
example for manufacturing um it's still

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.960
a question right like you might want to

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.520
benefit from the fact that manufacturing

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.199
provides a little bit of structuring. So

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.800
you know which objects are going to be

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.479
ahead of time, you know, um the uh

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.960
furniture and fixture you're going to

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.560
encounter with. So you might want to put

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.280
that into pre-training.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.400
>> Yep. So in that the spectrum from fully

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.199
model based to fully end to end trained

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.600
uh there's different progressions of

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.199
abstracting more and more layers of like

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.360
perception

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.639
um high level cognition um dexterity

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.360
and the mobility.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.360
>> Got it. So like in the large behavior

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.840
model video and the associated paper

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.639
with it like where in that progression

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.800
is Atlas at that point in time. So

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.400
that's a great example. That is not a

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.639
system that ingests pixels and outputs

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.639
torqus, right? It's a system that

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:51.440
ingests pixels and it outputs commands

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.360
to more abstract representation of what

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.360
a robot should do. So it provides

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.520
commands for what the endeector should

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.680
do, what the feet should do, what the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.479
torso, what the hands should do. Yes.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.199
Yeah.

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:07.199
>> Hands, feet and torso should do. Below

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:08.880
that we have a very powerful whole body

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.639
controller that consumes that and

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.280
realizes that on the robot.

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.840
>> Y

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.120
>> right. So um that provides a layer of

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.759
abstraction that makes learning simpler

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.639
and reduces the amount of data that we

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.440
need to generate but still allows us to

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.440
exploit the high agility and strength of

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.280
a platform of a humanoid platform like

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.000
like Atlas. I mean, that's tricky

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.720
because like that that's not just a

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.479
technology progression thing. Like there

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.440
there's real frequency separation

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:45.199
between what Atlas is doing like with

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.360
its actuators versus like looking at a

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.319
scene and deciding what you need to do

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.120
next? Like is it necessarily a given

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:55.520
that should be one neural network?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.199
>> No. Uh absolutely it's not a given that

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.599
it should be just one single neural

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:02.560
network. In fact, it is pretty common

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:06.000
for especially dynamic balancing robots

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.680
like humanoids or quadruplets to rely on

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.960
what we call system one, system two

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.880
separation where you have a system at

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.800
the lowest level which takes care of

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.599
whole body control. That the system that

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.240
needs to run very fast and needs to know

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:24.319
and understand sort of the extent of the

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.919
strength and the balance of the robot.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.840
It needs to know that you shouldn't move

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.680
your hand too fast over in this

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.240
direction without counterbalancing.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.000
>> Sure. So that's like your in humans

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.880
that'd be like your cerebellum in your

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.360
nervous system.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.440
>> So it's unclear that you might want to

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.440
force everything else in your system

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.000
that is in charge of acquiring common

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.039
sense to also have to learn in

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.360
particular for Dexter's manipulation.

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:50.880
>> Okay. So we got a complete plan to build

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.800
a robot brain.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.000
>> Yeah, we should. Now we just need to

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.080
execute.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.639
>> Um, so let's let's Yeah. So like let's

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:03.199
go back and recap like so what does it

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:05.280
mean to build it generalist and like

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:08.479
what are the essential uh

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.919
characteristics of that thing? Uh or

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:12.319
what are the characteristics that thing

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:14.560
will have to have for us to be

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:16.319
successful in putting humanoids to work?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.440
>> I would say that there's like four core

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:22.560
tenants, right? So general purpose

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.479
hardware and you've talked about it um

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.960
ease of retasking very important um to

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:30.879
avoid the issues with the cost of

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.240
integration of every sing uh every

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:36.880
single task. Ease of retasking and

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.839
getting to a point where it's not months

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.360
but rather it's days or hours what it

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:42.320
takes to get a robot to do a certain

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.880
job. Yeah,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.519
>> natural interfaces for interacting with

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.279
the robot rather than requiring expert

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:53.760
programming. Um, as and our customers

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:56.080
will want a more natural way to tell

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.440
robots what to do either with natural

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.279
language or with direct demonstrations.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.839
And the fourth one, safety around

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.656
people.

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:04.880
>> Did you get reliability in there?

00:09:03.656 --> 00:09:09.120
[laughter]

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.040
>> Uh, yes. Um, I did not get it. But

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.160
>> so we got five. Let's Okay, let's say

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.480
let's say five.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
>> Yeah. So, we're building this general

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.680
purpose robot. We're building a general

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.000
purpose robot brain. In conjunction with

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.360
that, one of the really cool things

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.680
about working with the Hyundai group is

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.519
we're not just building this robot in a

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.279
vacuum. like we're also redesigning car

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:36.880
plants and redesigning general

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:39.680
manufacturing facilities alongside

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.040
understanding what Atlas's capabilities

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.279
will be. Can you tell me a little bit

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.360
about what's exciting about that to you?

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:50.080
>> The first one is that I think working

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.640
with Hyundai has made the mission very

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.040
clear.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.600
>> Yeah.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.279
>> Right. like our mission is to transform

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.560
manufacturing

00:09:55.279 --> 00:10:02.240
and um once you know that that's clear

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:06.160
it's um it relieves a lot of pressure

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.480
and stress of like actually thinking and

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.640
dreaming about any other application

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.120
domain where you could also be working

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.880
which there are many and which we might

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.040
go also after but what's non-negotiable

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.839
is that we need to solve and transform

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.839
manufacturing so that has in um I think

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:25.680
exciting to me the fact that we have a

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:27.600
clear mission which is very hard but it

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.399
is clear. Yeah, that I mean that was

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:34.000
honestly one of the hardest parts of the

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:37.120
early days of spot was you we had this

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
amazing robot and we had so many

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.720
application ideas for you know what it

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.440
could be really really useful for like

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.480
today we look at spot and we see it

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.200
being used all over in these industrial

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.320
inspection applications and it seems

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.040
obvious now but like in the early days

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.079
we were spread really thin and between

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.440
so many different applications testing

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:06.800
and trying to do demos of each of them.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:10.079
It's really really refreshing [laughter]

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.760
with Atlas knowing that you know if we

00:11:10.079 --> 00:11:16.959
can just solve this manufacturing

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.399
problem that we can be successful and

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:20.560
then we can go into the rest of the

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:22.880
stuff. You know we can we're not going

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.760
to stop at manufacturing. We're going to

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.079
do curbto delivery. We're going to put

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.839
robots in your home, clean your tables,

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:30.720
make your bed, but we know which one we

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:33.760
have to do first.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:38.480
>> Like before joining BD, I was faculty at

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:41.120
MIT. And as faculty, um um the journey

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.040
is always about finding the right

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.320
motivation to solve the problem that you

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.920
think you should be solving, right? Like

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.760
you always have to convince yourself

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.160
actually am I solving the right problem

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.560
or am I confused? Should I should be

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.560
solving a different one? Um, so the

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.240
change to BD has been refreshing also

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.399
because of that like I don't have to ask

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.160
that question myself anymore. I know

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:03.120
what problem I need to solve.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.880
>> Yeah, I I feel the same way. What do you

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.480
think your team looks forward to and

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.839
enjoys the most dayto-day?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.360
>> I think the team is very excited about

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:13.360
um

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.399
I don't know if the team but myself I am

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.560
very excited about the prospects of

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:19.040
really enabling Dexter's manipulation.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.320
Mhm.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.760
>> I think that that is the ultimate

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:31.279
frontier of what it means to do general

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:35.120
purpose work. Um and um BD is a place

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:38.399
where you get to experience both the

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:43.600
design and fabrication of

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:46.240
um high-end um Dextrous grippers and you

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.480
get to experience the development of the

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.920
techniques that are going to get those

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:56.079
grippers to do very cool things like

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:59.360
using tools like handling objects. Um,

00:12:56.079 --> 00:13:02.000
and to me experiencing that and seeing

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.880
that sort of rapidly progressing is

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.440
fascinating.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.240
>> The uh I got to answer this myself. I

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.320
have so much fun. The you know the the

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.079
really special thing about robotics as

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.480
opposed to any other place that you

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:15.760
could be working in machine learning or

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.600
really in any of the functional

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.320
disciplines is that like we we do the

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.240
whole thing. Like so you mentioned, you

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.639
know, folks at Boston Dynamics design

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.600
grippers and like if you're a machine

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:31.839
learning researcher, you get to talk to

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.240
the folks that design the fingertips

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:36.320
dayto day, argue with them, you get to

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.040
see your stuff show up in the hands 3

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.200
months later. Um, and it extends all the

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.560
way through the other side too. So like

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.959
we have folks who work on robots

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.079
daytoday, diagnose things. We also have

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:52.240
folks who, you know, sit 15 ft further

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:54.160
away from the robots in the lab who

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.560
think about how do I wrangle a thousand

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.760
GPUs to run this training job faster.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.079
Like you you see every aspect of putting

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.120
a robot together all in one room.

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:05.199
>> Yep.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.959
>> I don't think it's it's there's very few

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:07.600
places in the world where you can get

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.959
that.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.040
>> It's very exciting.

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:13.040
>> Well, thanks Alberto. Thanks for telling

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:16.399
us what's going on on the ML side of

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.279
Atlas. Um, and we'll uh I know we'll

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:20.800
have to see how fast uh we we get to

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:23.360
that full generalist.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.360
>> Yes.
