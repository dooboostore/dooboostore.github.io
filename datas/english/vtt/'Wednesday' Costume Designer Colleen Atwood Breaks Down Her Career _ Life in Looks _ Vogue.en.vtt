00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.720
I am Colleen Atwood and this is my life

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.720
in looks.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.200
[Music]

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.040
Whoa. Edward Scissor Hands. The process

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.720
of making Edward Scissorhand come to

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.199
life was really like a visceral process.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.439
He was born from Orchard Street, Canal

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.000
Street back in the day in the 80s when

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.000
there was all these boxes of leather and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.119
findings and all these stuff that these

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.679
guys sold. His leather suit was mainly

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.160
from Jobers on Orchard Street where I

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.320
just go get, you know, a cool piece of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.040
leather with a texture and put the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.280
puzzle together gradually combined with

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.800
some stretch materials. Those days we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.079
didn't make a lot of multiples. So there

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.800
are really only two authentic OG Edward

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.960
Scissor Hand costumes around. And the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.079
real part of the costume that I think

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.480
for all of us, me, Johnny, and Tim were

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.640
in a room at Stan Winston's who made the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.399
hands. We were there coordinating the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.320
hands and the costumes, but the minute

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.799
he put these hands on that are like

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.760
gloves was one of those moments in your

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.080
life that's like magical. With costumes

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.439
like this, it's often, you know, the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.360
fear of people, oh, it's going to take

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.280
forever to get in and out of. And it

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.720
really is like putting on pants and a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.640
shirt and wrapping it around and

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.040
buckling it. Poor Johnny wearing it in

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.880
Florida in 90° weather the whole time

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.880
was the hardest part. Like just drying

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.119
it out in between cuz it was really

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.439
really hot there. I was influenced in

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.320
that period by early Goautier who had

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.439
been using stretch with with nonstretch

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.520
fabrics to make it fit tightly but still

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.159
move. And it was really important to me

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.159
that this costume was able to move and

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.759
not just bag out like leather does if

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.439
you don't have anything behind it. Back

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.680
then there wasn't stretch leather like

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.320
there is today.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.960
Oh my god, Handmmaid's Tail. I forgot

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.240
about that one. The color coding it was

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.320
very very strongly supported by the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.240
director who really wanted the colors

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.399
symbolizing the order of the people in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.320
the story. There was a designer I think

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.320
named Zoran in New York at the time

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.479
period who was very influential on how

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.080
the director wanted the clothes to look.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.480
That kind of Soho kind of vibe, it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.040
really influenced those costumes in that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.879
period in the 80s. What I remember the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.040
most about it is myself and the head of

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.879
the hair department did everybody's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.959
ponytails every day because we were

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:29.080
obsessed with them being a certain way

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.080
and then putting on the scarves.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.239
Silence of the Lambs. The way it was

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.920
written and the way it was envisioned by

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.680
Ted Thally I think and Jonathan was so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.959
terrifying that you're kind of in the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.360
middle of the night waking up and

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.440
checking your doors. Often times in

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.280
costumeuming there you're making things.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.680
You want to have a feeling of them being

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.720
manufactured, not being something that's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.239
so craft oriented. And in this case,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.160
Jonathan had a lot of thoughts about

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.560
what this mask could be. Should it be

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.360
leather? Should it be just rope and like

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.760
kind of more basic and old-fashioned?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.080
But I really felt it should be a version

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.840
of what's happening today. And I was

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.280
looking at all these hockey masks and I

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.000
was like, you know, that's really the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.920
best tech that's out there today. And I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.239
found this uh guy, I believe he was in

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.159
New Jersey, who made these masks. The

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.840
great story about this mask is

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.080
originally we were going to paint it,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.400
but the first proto came in, it looked

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.680
like dead skin, and we're like, "Oh my

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.200
god, this is so much better than

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.280
painting it." But we didn't even think

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.040
about it. It is actually fiberglass,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.599
which probably shouldn't be on anyone's

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.080
face in that state, but we didn't know

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.799
better then.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.080
Little Women, a wonderful job. It was my

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.799
first period film and I was able to find

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.959
a lot of authentic fabrics. I bought a

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.040
lot of dresses from the period that were

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.640
half rotten and things were, you know,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.519
not good about them, but I took them

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.000
apart and repurposed the material and I

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.480
felt like it really was art imitating

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.319
life because really in that period

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.000
people did that with their clothes. We

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.760
even had one dress which was, you know,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
everyone was terrified about. But I

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.920
really wanted Blair Danes to wear one of

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.159
Winona's dresses because people had

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.920
handme-downs and they everyone was

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.000
freaking out cuz like what if we have to

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.479
have continuity and d I was like who

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.560
cares? Like we can go back, you know? It

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.639
was just like a really great movie for

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.759
me in the fact that it really

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.240
familiarized me with the fabric of the

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.000
period and the sort of texture of the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.080
production design and the the lighting

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.960
and everything really worked together to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.919
create that world.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.479
A look at Oprah beloved. My influence

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.520
with actors in films is always a

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.520
collaborative process. I always show

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.759
them a bible that I've done of the story

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.080
how I see it just kind of a flow of the

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.479
film and it's always a funny process cuz

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.000
some actors are very engaged by it and

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.400
some of them you're just like what am I

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.960
going to wear? Oprah in this case of

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.759
Beloved was very respectful of Tony

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.199
Morrison's vision of the story but also

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.759
very respectful of having these costumes

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.280
that people actually made by hand. And I

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.320
think it was really interesting for

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.600
someone, you know, as massive as Oprah

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.240
with style and everything to just really

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.720
kind of hone it down and appreciate the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.720
simplicity of these costumes and the

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.800
story that we were telling with these

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.639
characters.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:30.080
A Christina so beautiful. Sleepy Hollow.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.880
It's a fantastical story. It's a tale.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.280
It's a fable. Chebo Emanuel Lubiski's

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.280
lighting was a huge part of that show.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.199
The kind of idea that Christina Richi

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.840
was this glowing thing and that it was

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.440
like a world surrounded by darkness. And

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.080
I think that that's what Tim was

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.880
depicting in the telling of Sleepy

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.199
Hollow, the stuff that wasn't there. It

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.520
was my first film in the UK and I really

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.080
was cutting these clothes in a way that

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.160
they weren't very happy with me about in

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.080
the sense that I really wanted to take

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.000
them to a different level. I expanded

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.319
the skirts. I did all kinds of things to

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.400
the shapes and in the beginning the

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.400
people in the workroom were just like

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.880
well it's not Janet Arnold which is a

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.360
familiar face to them in in pattern

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.800
making but once we got into it and they

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.319
saw what I was doing with the fabrics

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.840
and the lighting and stuff they were

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:20.560
really excited about it and it was

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.960
really a great turnaround for me as a

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.280
designer working with fellow artisans.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.440
These kind of movies especially these

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.600
sort of period films everything then was

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.680
sewn by hand. So the hand on everything

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.400
and the finishing is really important to

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.639
me. In that area, I had an amazing

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.639
textile artist that did the horseman's

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.479
cape and all the aging on the horsemen

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.919
and the screening on that, which was the

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.199
first time I'd worked with people of

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:48.319
that level in that area.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.160
Catherine the Great, Chicago. When I

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.319
started Chicago, my first meeting with

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.720
Rob Marshall, I just finished Planet of

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.880
the Apes with Tim, which was such an

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.319
action movie, like all these layers on

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.400
layers that these guys had to do all

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.639
this work. And I was showing Rob the the

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.599
book, and I said, "This doesn't scare me

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:08.000
at all doing dance. I can see what it

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.240
takes to make these costumes work." My

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.639
fashion inspiration from Chicago really

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.560
came from the period and from a lot of

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.120
Versailles photographs, different

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.360
photography like Manray, sort of the

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.680
grittier side of life. It was kind of

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.160
the first time photographs weren't so

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.160
formal. It was sort of more jouro kind

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.240
of photography and it was really

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.160
interesting for me to look at that

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.000
because I knew the standard pretty

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.680
photography but it was great to go a

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.319
little bit deeper. The biggest challenge

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.440
on Chicago was the budget which was very

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:42.800
small. The dance numbers in Chicago, we

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.759
shot usually in about a 16-hour day. The

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.560
dancers and the actors had to perform

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:51.120
that long in one costume. I did not have

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.880
multiples. You just stood on the side

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.520
poised with a needle and thread waiting

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.120
for something to blow up on you. And

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.280
that's kind of how we got through the

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.080
job.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.560
Jim Carrey, Lemony Snickickets. In

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.800
Lemony Snickicket, I really made kind of

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.759
quiet plea to myself that I was going to

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.759
create the textiles themselves. So, I

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:14.240
took textiles and took them apart,

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:16.879
applied them to other things. Gymsuit is

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.720
like strips of wool cut with metal base

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:20.800
behind it, which is why the stripes have

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.039
that strange kind of iridescence to them

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.440
that isn't just a hard stripe. I just

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:27.440
was really into the baby's dress as one

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.080
of my favorite costumes I've ever made

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.959
because it was really dark taffida with

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.360
a layer of baby pink on top and it just

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:38.240
made it the sickest most amazing color

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:42.240
and every element of it had a a feeling

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.640
of something being made by hand.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.200
Memoirs of a geisha. That's a good

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.440
memory. In Memoirs of Agasha, it was a

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.720
really terrifying project as a designer

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.200
because you're honoring a 500year-old

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.480
culture. It was really important to me

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.880
to know what was real in what the gay

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.440
show wore. So, I had a lot of research

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.560
that I went by. Then I got the cast and

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.279
the cast were quite tall and willowy,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.839
beautiful women. The actual real geisha

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:14.720
clothes were made for people much much

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:16.480
more compact and smaller. And I was

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.440
totally like going, "What am I going to

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.480
do?" But I went to a show in Tokyo, an

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.200
art exhibit of an illustrator from the

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.839
30s in Japan. He set me free because

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.839
he'd done all these illustrations that

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:32.560
were kind of the idea of what I wanted

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:34.640
to do with the costumes. And at that

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.880
point, I took the proportions and played

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.440
with them and made them work better on

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.560
our cast.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.680
Sweeney Todd. Sweeny's neck tie was

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.760
actually one piece of fabric I had very

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.519
little of. It was an old handwoven piece

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.480
of fabric. It was blood everywhere in

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.480
that movie. And you're just like,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.240
everyone's freaking out about the scar,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.839
this tie, the tie. And I was like, I

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.399
don't care. I want this tie. And then

00:09:55.839 --> 00:10:00.240
Steve Gal, who was my textile artist, we

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:02.720
printed fake ones so they looked good

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.279
for, you know, the blood work. I really

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.680
wanted it to be a black and white and

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:10.320
gray character. So, I liked using all

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.800
the warm and cool tones of all those

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.360
colors together to evoke, you know, the

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.120
moodiness of Sweeney

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.279
nine. Beautiful Nicole. The early 60s

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.200
high Italian fashion is one of my

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:25.680
favorite periods. It's just so

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.839
classically elegant and a throwaway at

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.079
the same time. It isn't as stuffy as the

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:32.240
Americans were. It's a little more real.

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:33.920
like it's really glamorous but you

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.600
believe people actually wore it and

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.760
lived in it and that's that was their

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.959
lifestyle. And then you have Sophia

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.040
Luren, Marian Kotiard, Penelopey Nicole

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:45.839
like you know on and on. I mean just

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:49.279
amazing cast of of actors for this

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:52.160
movie. It was all made costumes. We did

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:55.760
have jewelry from Shopart in this photo.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.240
Nicole's bracelet was Chopard bracelet.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.000
Uh Queenie we called her. This

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.920
collaboration with Tim was really

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.640
special to both of us because we both

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.640
loved the Tanel drawings of the early

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.120
Alice. And then we knew that the

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.040
audience was slightly more familiar with

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.680
the Disney version of Alice than Louis

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.560
Carol's novels. To juggle like taking

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.920
something that's a beloved sort of image

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.880
of a character like Alice and and

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.560
putting her into a new vibe was

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.800
something that we're like we're just

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.560
going the blue dress. How do we lose it?

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.160
Tim really figured out. He goes, "How

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.839
come when she shrinks and grows her

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.560
clothes they just shrink and grow with

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:36.000
her? Let's have her just like shrink and

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.839
then she's in like this kind of

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
underwear thing and then she grows and

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:41.760
she's in something else." So, it really

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.240
set us free from that and it was a

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.240
really fun thing to collaborate with. We

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.640
were also dealing at a time before

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.040
technology was quite what it is today.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.800
Helena's costume was an especially big

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.440
challenge where we had to have the

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.079
collar and cheat the neckline lower in

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:01.120
order to make the head fit on the body

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:04.399
in a way that worked low tac which was a

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:07.200
fun learning curve for me.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:08.959
Merryill as a blue witch. My research

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.880
for Into the Woods was somewhat fairy

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:12.639
tales but also is like Merryill's

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.399
opening in the show. She comes out of a

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:17.519
tree and I really liked her being the

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:20.000
textures of bark. And I'd fooled around

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:22.560
on something else with these leather

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.880
cords put on chiffon. You could twist it

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.279
like bark. It was like fortun but a

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.160
little bit more dynamic in a sense of

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:32.240
what you could do with it. So I did that

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.480
with her initial costume which is really

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.399
a ratty, you know, she'd been living in

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.320
the woods forever like a mad woman's

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:39.920
costume. She comes in and we're

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.519
thinking, "Do you need a hump?" And like

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.279
we put the thing on and we have the big

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:45.680
sleeves and everything and she like

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:47.040
stoops over in it and we're like, you

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.800
know, she doesn't really need it. She

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.360
can do it with her acting cuz she's such

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.800
a great movement actress. This costume

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.120
here was her fancy high-end witch's

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.040
concept of a beautiful mother witch,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.120
which we also had fun with. Made with

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.639
the same technique, but with ribbons in

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.680
with the cord, so it had a little bit

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:08.079
more silky quality to it.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.560
Eddie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:13.040
Find Them. When I first read a script, a

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.519
lot of times I see the character like I

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.880
see this little guy that's introverted

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:20.800
and shy in the world and think of how to

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.720
make clothes that make him like that. In

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.600
a same way, in a kind of whacked out

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.519
way, I thought of him as a bird, like a

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.160
robin. And I don't know if it's cuz I'd

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:32.800
seen a robin in my yard that day, but I

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.399
like the colors of robins a lot. And I

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.480
thought, "Oh, I'll make his waist coat

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:40.240
kind of like the color of a robin, but a

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.480
little bluer. not quite so sad.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.079
I think when I do a show like Wednesday,

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.240
you never know what it's going to mean

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:47.680
to anybody. It's fun to see it go on the

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.760
street. It's fun to see how people

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.680
interpret it and people reinterpreting

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.120
each character and how much they embrace

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.959
Enid and how much they embrace

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.800
Wednesday. And it's fun to see on

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:58.240
Halloween that, you know, people are

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.720
coming to your door that are like

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.720
Wednesday Adams. So are their moms. And

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.959
so you're just like, "Oh, wow. This is

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.680
like something to people." I've had a

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:10.000
few great costumes in my past for

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.240
Halloween, like the Martian Girl, Edward

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.800
Scissor Hands, Wednesday, Hannibal

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.440
Lectctor,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.160
Ariel, the Little Mermaid, a challenge

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.240
and fun. I designed all the tales for

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.639
all the sisters and stuff with digital

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.040
artists that use them in the movies with

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:29.839
depicting actual fish from the seven

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.839
seas to have that vibe. Even though it's

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:34.000
not really a big part of the story, it

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:37.360
was a really fun element of the design,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.199
the embracing of the sea world and and

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.000
human world of all different cultures.

00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:44.000
With Ariel's costume above land, she was

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
going into the palace and the palace was

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.920
dressing her. So, she couldn't really

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.440
look like the queen, but she couldn't

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.279
really look like the servant. She was

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.519
somewhere in the middle. So, the blouse

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:55.920
is like more like an aristocratic kind

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:58.480
of beautiful little silk blouse. And the

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.399
corset is handmade like somebody's made

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.320
it. And then the skirts, like tucks and

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:04.240
tucks of coral, reminiscent of the

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.320
ocean. And of course, she had to be the

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.480
color of the sea. I messed around with a

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.560
lot of blues and stuff with it, but I

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.959
ended up in this kind of pale turquoise

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.519
color. Creating a a character within the

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:18.000
IP of an existing character is always a

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:20.240
challenge. But I think if the actors can

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.760
do it, then you can just kind of follow

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:26.880
suit and make it all work.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.240
Masters of the Air, a huge challenge. It

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.720
was hundreds of costumes manufactured.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.680
So I sourced really good materials from

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.639
all over the world. I found real pieces

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.519
and redid patterns that were currently

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:43.440
being sold by leather manufacturers. So

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:45.040
I had to go into the manufacturing

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.199
world, but I controlled it by the

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.040
pattern making side of it. Also, a lot

00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:50.880
of times in these shows, nothing's

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.440
really aged. Nothing looks like people

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.199
really wore it for a long time. And it

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.360
was really important to me to have it

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:59.600
really feel worn in and real on all

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.839
these guys.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.320
The beautiful Monica in Beetlejuice.

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:06.000
Beetlejuice. The funny thing about Tim

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.040
was I've been working with him for 30

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.959
years and I always read about like Tim

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.040
Burton's doing this and then he calls me

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:15.360
goes, you know, I might be doing this

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.199
thing like it's a secret cuz he doesn't

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.560
like to talk about stuff until he's

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:22.560
doing it and I always act surprised.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.160
Oh, really? It's an interesting

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.040
challenge to take something as

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.880
contemporary as Beetlejuice and do your

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.040
version of it because people really

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.800
remember it. You know, the main thing is

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.320
I got some of the real stuff. I had him

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.320
feeding with fitting with Michael and

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.920
he's like, I remember the the text was

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.360
my favorite thing. Where's the real one?

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.560
And I was like, I got it. And he's

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.120
going, oh wow. It's just like people

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.600
remember things in a way when they see

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.160
it. The memory is more beautiful than

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.839
what the actual reality of the object

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.720
is.

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:57.440
Leo in probably the most disgusting

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.120
costume he's had to wear. The process of

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.959
working with Paul Thomas Anderson is

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.800
like no other. We had all these sessions

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:05.120
at his house where we take pictures of

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.199
stuff. We talk about stuff with Leo's

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.919
character especially and with Willis and

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:11.679
we try on things and take pictures and

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:14.160
he'd, you know, do different things with

00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:16.400
the army guys. And as stuff came along

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.880
and it worked, then it became the

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.120
costume for the movie. We did fittings,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.360
proper fittings as well. But it was

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.760
mainly that fluid process that brought

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.480
together the look of the film for Leo

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.039
and for um Chase Infinity's character

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.039
and it was really a road movie. So stuff

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:35.679
was in all kinds of environments. We

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:37.440
didn't have tons of multiples. I I got

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:40.240
the fabric for Leo's robe and made the

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.520
robes and then we needed more and I

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.120
called them and they go, "Oh, we don't

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.120
have that anymore." So we were stuck

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.120
with like six robes for the whole movie,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.360
which is not that many for what he had

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.440
to do in it. But, you know, it it just

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.520
worked in a way that, you know, you

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.280
don't need sometimes so much stuff.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:00.720
Sometimes it's good to not have it.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.880
Jennifer Lopez as the Spiderwoman. The

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.799
use of color in Kiss of the Spiderwoman

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:09.360
was really inspired by the films of the

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:12.080
40s, the musical films where color was

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.320
really choreographed, orchestrated, and

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.840
we really dove into it that way, which

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.760
was a lot of fun because you really

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.240
could control all the color in the room.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.400
Was a great process. It was a fantastic

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.400
job. Bill Condan, the director, is a

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.360
master at musicals. He knows everything

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.679
there is to know about them on film. and

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.160
her chops as an actress and as a dancer

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:34.960
are beyond belief. I think my favorite

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:38.559
part of making musicals is actually

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.720
making costumes for actors but also the

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:42.720
dancers and what they have to do in the

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.120
costumes. It's really fun to do that. I

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.760
like music a lot. I do stuff for bands

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.960
sometimes every once in a while and it's

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.120
just really great part of of making

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:57.200
things to bring joy to people. Wow. That

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.679
was my life in looks. At least half my

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.679
life in looks

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:18.890
