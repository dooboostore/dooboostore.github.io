00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.960
Please welcome Andrew Ross. Sorcin and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.160
his guest, co-founder and CEO of

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.160
Palanteer, Alex Karp.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.920
>> Good morning everybody.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.320
Palanteer's Alex Karp is here and we are

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.480
going to get into it. Alex, thank you

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.239
for being here. Um, Palanteer is named

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.879
uh after uh the seeing stones in JRR's

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.199
Tolken's Lord of the Rings. Uh Palencier

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.879
has a complicated, let's say sometimes

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.199
secretive, controversial business that

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.879
helps the US uh and other countries and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.400
governments around the world make sense

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.400
of complicated data. That's what they

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.240
do. Its business has soared in the age

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.720
of artificial intelligence. Today, it is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.000
among the top 30 most valuable companies

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.320
in the world. It is worth 4400 billion

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.439
dollars. And after October 7th, Karp has

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.520
been perhaps singularly the most

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.360
outspoken CEO in America to support

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.680
Israel. week after the attack he took

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.000
out a full page ad in this newspaper the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.400
New York Times had four words on it said

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.560
Palanteer stands with Israel should say

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.560
the IDF and MSAD are clients of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.759
Palunteer but there are a lot of

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.840
questions about what they are doing here

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.000
in the US including their contract with

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.159
ICE and their work around the world and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.240
we are going to talk about all of it

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.799
Alex thank you for being with us

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.680
>> couldn't imagine why we're controversial

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.079
couldn't imagine

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.640
>> let let's discuss this because I think

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.880
um and I I mean this By the way, I see

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.280
that as we're on the side of I mean, you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.079
know, when you when you support allies

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.560
in funny on in Israel, which I guess

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.200
typically is the most controversial in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.560
public, honestly, interestingly, often

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.520
the least controversial in private um is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.239
uh it's like it doesn't actually, and I

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.239
do support all those things, it doesn't

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.480
actually mean that you support every

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.400
decision. It means you support them

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.480
having a superior position to their

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.040
adversaries. I mean that that really

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.680
starts with America which is you know I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.319
think one of the the real problems that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.120
you know the non-controversial companies

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.720
have is they can't admit what they think

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.560
in private which is they believe what

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.480
they're doing is better and superior to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.840
what other people are doing. I want to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.599
get into all of that but I'll tell you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.959
where I want to start. I want to start

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.959
with this. You wrote a book last year

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.280
called the technological republic and

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.440
you quote Samuel Huntington in it and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.319
you that argues the following argues

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.360
that the rise of the west was not made

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.480
possible quote by the superiority of its

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.160
ideas or values or religion but rather

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.760
by its superiority in applying organized

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.680
violence.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.800
What do you mean by that? And is that

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.400
what Palanteer ultimately does?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.080
Well, I I I think one of the most

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400
interesting about that about the quotes

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.959
that quote is it's indisputably and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.959
obviously true.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.640
>> And you you genuinely believe that the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.760
US this idea of ideas, values, religion

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.959
has nothing to do with it. You think it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.120
really is about organizing violence?

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.080
>> No, no, no. Sorry. I didn't say that our

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.599
ideas aren't important. Obviously, I I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.120
come from an academic family and I was

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.480
planning to be an academic before I

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.640
realized it was worthless and I'd be

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.799
better at building things. Um but

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.599
>> we should talk about that, too. But um

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.040
but like okay one of the biggest one of

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.959
the biggest problems we have in our

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.799
elite institutions especially our IV

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.640
leagues is this indisputable truth that

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.360
no one would listen to the superior of

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.080
our ideas if our ability to organize in

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.400
violence was inferior that every single

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.560
person in the world believes outside of

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.040
the faculty of Harvard and certainly all

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.879
of our adversaries know to be true is

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.519
viewed as something that's kind of

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.760
worthy of great discussion and dispute.

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.400
And the primary reason they dispute it

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.400
honestly is because at their core they

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.439
they want to undermine the superiority

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.000
of western values which are meritocracy,

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.479
rule of law, accepting that inputs and

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.959
outputs are not the same that are the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.199
basis of building the superiority on the

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.800
military on the military plane.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.800
>> You think that the university culture is

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.639
trying to undermine that? Well, I think

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.360
it's one of I think it's moved from the

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.960
50s where it was trying to explain why

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.440
our constitution is the best way to

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.919
organize our lives, not others. Why why

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.160
meritocracy is necessary even if it

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.680
means letting in immigrants to your

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.840
institution. Uh why why inputs and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.919
outputs aren't the same, why the first,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.880
second, third, fourth amendment are are

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.199
are unique and why it was worth standing

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.560
up for these values has literally been

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.479
transformed especially in the humanities

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.800
departments too. Of course, none of that

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.560
could work because no one like us is

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.320
good at doing that basically. I mean,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.639
that's like and therefore it could the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.160
whole thing couldn't work and and

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.720
downstream of that is enormous

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.280
dysfunction and you see this all in all

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.240
sorts of issues.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.919
Our primary and most important adversary

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.440
I say adversary consciously and not

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:24.800
enemy

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.080
I is China and we will decide AI and the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.720
ability to implement it on the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.000
battlefield primarily will decide the

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.759
values i.e the the norms, the laws, and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.919
the spirit of the laws that are imposed

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.400
upon us across the globe. And if you

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.160
think for a minute they believe anything

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.639
that of the that we're being taught in

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.320
our idiotic faculty, you are even more

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.120
idiotic than the professors teaching

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.680
you. And and I'll tell you, if you

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.000
actually believe in these values, again,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.680
I'm not a neoconi. Never was. That's why

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.680
I'm skeptical of immigration because I

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.199
don't think cultural all this cultural

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.800
assimilation hasn't worked in the last

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.400
50 years. And that's an obvious truth.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.240
You're also not allowed to say I'm

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.160
skeptical of imposing values on other

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.160
people. I never believed we could we

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.360
should or try to make the Arab Middle

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.639
East Wilsonian uh people like a

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.840
Wilsonian ideal imposed upon them.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.680
I if you believe for a second that

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.039
anyone else outside this country

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.639
believes that we are going to defend our

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.720
values without superiority and moral

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.720
violence, you you're just living in a

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.479
world that doesn't exist. It does not

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.000
exist. and no matter how much you try to

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.639
impose it on the rest of us, it still

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.240
won't exist.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.400
>> Okay. I want to talk about you for a

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.759
second and your own politics and your

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.600
shift in politics. By the way, there's a

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.039
piece in the Washington Post about you

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.199
this morning that gets into some of

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.800
this. Um, you grew up

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.319
>> only because I have great respect for

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.319
you. I don't interrupt you immediately.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.479
I didn't shift my politics. The

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.120
political parties have shifted their

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.479
politics. The the idea that what's being

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.800
called progressive is in any way

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.240
progressive is a complete farce. I've

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.720
been progressive since the beginning of

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.520
Palunteer. I'm continue to be progress.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.080
I grew up in a highly intellectually

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.759
intellectual mostly Jewish incredibly

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.000
left-wing environment. And every

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.840
Saturday and every Friday I heard a

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.199
lecture about how the conservatives are

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.639
going to destroy this country with

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.039
illegal immigration because it's going

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:17.199
to undermine the fabric of the American

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:19.039
worker. That was 50 years ago. That's

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:21.759
what be means to be a progressive. Being

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.280
progressive doesn't mean just oh I oh it

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.120
feels so good to be involved in

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.039
dysfunction things that can never work a

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.720
form of socialism that's never worked

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:30.720
having no meritocracy that's not

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.440
progressive that's pretend that's

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.080
honestly cowardly and most people on

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.400
very half my old party knows it they

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.240
don't speak up it's it will

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.919
never work and it does not help you know

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.520
the biggest problem with that is it's

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.800
not helping the poor people that they

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.560
claim to hurt if you think that's

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.199
helping a black person in the inner city

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.800
you're ridiculous the Last thing anyone

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.880
in this country needs is a dysfunctional

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.160
educational system and handouts that

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.720
have never worked and are not going to

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.919
work.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.120
>> Okay. Let me let me ask you though

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:58.720
because I know you say you you didn't

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.520
shift your view, but I I do want to read

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.720
you something that that appears as if

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.360
you shifted your view. Uh this is back

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.840
in 2017

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.879
uh about Trump. You said, quote, "I

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.440
respect nothing about the dude. It would

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:18.080
be hard to make up someone I find less

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.000
appealing." You know, there's a lot of

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.759
things that are about quoted about me

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.919
that were like not quoted in public.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:26.319
Like in this book that you know, my

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:28.879
there's tons and tons of quotes. I'll

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:30.800
give you a different version of this. A

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:32.240
lot of these quote not you're not really

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.959
doing this and I have a actually we've

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.560
been at this for almost a decade and he

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:38.000
was kind enough to interview me when I

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.760
was a complete clown and joke to

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.360
everyone else besides me and our mly

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.640
crew of Palunteer and I greatly

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.720
appreciate that. Uh um one of the

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.720
biggest lessons and just a slight detour

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.040
to to the wonderful and very important

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.200
country of Germany that is seeming to be

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.880
crashing its German functionality and

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.399
competence into a plane uh into a like

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.959
uh into the ground of political

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:04.480
correctness that it somehow can't escape

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:07.519
for historical reasons. Um the minute

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.279
you judge somebody by anything but the

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:11.440
issues you agree with. So in Germany,

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:13.279
the Green Party and the Socialist have

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.200
convinced the majority party they can

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:18.320
never vote with the far right on

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.720
immigration. I care about two issues. I

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.200
care about immigration and

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.760
reestablishing the deterrent capacity of

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.959
America without being a colonialist

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.880
neocon view. And on those two issues,

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:32.480
those two issues, this president has

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.839
performed. And those are the two issues

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.760
I care about. So, what were the issues

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.760
that you you you didn't agree with when

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.040
when you said he was not an appealing

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.760
dude before?

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.880
>> Well, what was that?

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.800
>> Well, first of all, you're quoting

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.600
somebody who's quoting me off the record

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.720
that's in the public record. I care

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.360
about two issues. I am not going to be

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.120
proxy coraled into having no power by

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.519
something of like, well, I care about

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.519
these two issues. He's def he by the

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:59.040
way, I was a supporter of the Democratic

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:01.519
Party. What two issues did the

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.120
Democratic Party not perform on? Does

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:06.080
anyone think the Democratic Party

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.000
performed on migration or deterrence?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.519
That's crazy. You could now you could

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.200
care about different issues. I'm

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:14.160
pro-choice. It's not my number one

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.240
issue. I'm pro I'm wildly progay rights.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.040
It's not my number one issue. The minute

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.640
you allow yourself to be coraled into I

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.160
disagree with this person. I disagree.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.399
You've basically transferred your power

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.000
to one party. Palanteer and I am not

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.839
transferring my power of power power and

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
our influence which honestly you know

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:31.600
the main mainstream media at the

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.839
Washington Post and at the New York

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.839
Times doesn't always like me. That's

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:38.640
great because you know who does like me?

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:40.240
About 10 million people primarily dudes

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.079
in this country. And you know what? I'm

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.560
going to use my whole influence to make

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:47.120
sure this country stays skeptical on

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.640
migration and has a deterrent capacity

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.079
that it only uses selectively.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.640
>> Okay. Let me ask you this, and this goes

00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:54.320
to maybe um I don't if it has to do with

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.959
just being a blunt instrument,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.120
compassion, what have you. I think you

00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:00.640
could argue uh in terms of immigration

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.320
policy that you don't want to have

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.519
illegal immigrants in the country or you

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.320
want to prevent illegal immigrants from

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:09.360
coming into the country, etc. We are now

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.399
seeing uh ICE working its way around the

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.079
country. Um and oftentimes uh folks

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:16.880
taking people ripping people off the

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:20.320
streets with masks on.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:24.560
you and Palanteer are working hand in

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.160
hand with ICE. You that's public. What

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.320
do you make of that? What do you make of

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.440
the It's not necessarily the policy, but

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.160
the approach to the policy.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.000
>> Let me give you my critique of what I

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.440
would call I think you're this

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.320
questioning is proxy culpable of our

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.800
country has selective empathy for

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.600
everybody but working class particularly

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.279
white males. So when you look at when

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.360
you look at coverage in mainstream

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:51.040
newspapers about the constitutionality

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.760
of blowing up boats that are bringing

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.920
fentinol here, I guarantee you if that

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.399
fentinol was killing people at schools

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.320
we went to present potentially your kids

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:02.560
are going to, it would be constitutional

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:07.040
to blow up those boats. There is

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:10.720
selective MI instrument instrumental

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:13.360
uh use of of of empathy that somehow is

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.880
only applied at the point where it would

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.240
help to the idea of what

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.600
>> sorry sorry you asked the question

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.320
you're going to get the full answer you

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.839
don't want the the full answer you don't

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.480
want you brought me on stage you know

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:26.480
what you're getting okay it's uh and by

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.240
the way I'm on stage and I know a lot of

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.160
the people on stage sponsoring this are

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.959
skeptical of me you know why I'm on

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.240
stage here Because at Palanteer and I

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:36.560
would encourage you to think of this, I

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.720
divide the world into Palunteer

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.959
essentially in Palunteer derangement

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.600
syndrome, Palanteer skeptics and

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:45.519
Palanteer haters. My biggest fans

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.959
started off as Palanteer skeptics and

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:50.399
Palanteer haters. I believe that someday

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:52.079
almost everyone in this audience is

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:54.000
going to agree with me. You may not like

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:55.600
me now, but you're going to agree later.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.120
And I'll also tell you something. Look

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.880
to the left, look to the right. The

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.800
person you think is offended by this

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.360
actually agrees with me.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.720
That is 100% true.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.320
>> Okay. Well, okay. Sorry. And yeah, it's

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.760
100% true. And keep that in mind. I

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.920
would tell you I will tell you a secret

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.320
that I hope the New York Times and the

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.920
Washington Post doesn't listen to. Okay.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.360
Sorry. Let me I

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.120
>> I just want to bring us back to this one

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.079
issue, which is No, no. You talked about

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.600
the rule of law and you talked about uh

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:26.800
things being constitutional. And so,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.160
here we are. We're talking about these

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.639
uh boats, for example, that were blown

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.760
up, right? And uh whether you have

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:35.519
empathy for them or not given uh the

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.600
folks who are getting uh you know killed

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:39.760
by fentanyl the question is whether this

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.760
is being done on a constitutional basis

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.959
and being done in the right way and if

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.000
it's not being done in the right way how

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:48.240
you feel about that

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.480
>> of course but part of the reason why I

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.480
like this questioning is the more

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.240
constitutional you want to make it the

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.639
more precise you want to make it the

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.079
more you're going to need my product. So

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:59.279
you keep pushing on making it

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:01.120
constitutional. I'm totally supportive

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:02.720
of that. You know, a constitutional you

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.240
would need to understand where the where

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.399
the things are going, how are they

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.000
going, under what conditions, where do

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:10.079
they belong. But I'm asking you just as

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.920
a person on a on a sort of both sort of

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:16.800
a moral basis as a human when you see

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.000
people, young people, uh, mothers and

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.079
fathers and families getting ripped

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.399
apart with the masks on with the ice

00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:24.560
folks. How you what you think of that?

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:26.079
>> Of course. But you're this is you're at

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.240
this point you're abusing empathy

00:14:26.079 --> 00:14:31.120
because I of course don't like that,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.760
right? I no one likes that. No American.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.920
This is the fairest, least bigoted, most

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.320
open-minded culture in the world. If you

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.079
Okay.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.040
>> But if you don't like and you say, "Hey,

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:40.240
government, you and

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:45.519
>> you going to let me finish, please."

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:49.120
Okay. So, in this country, it you have

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:50.720
1% of the country in prison. 1% who were

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.480
in prison and therefore have no rights.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.199
Do you know what happens to you when you

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.360
go to prison? They take you away from

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:59.760
your kids. You know who that happens to?

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.519
Disproportionately workingass,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.199
disproportionately black and Hispanic

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:06.639
men and white men in the underclass.

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:09.680
Where are the thousands of articles

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:12.399
about them? Nobody cares. And they don't

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.639
care because it does not either serve

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:16.079
the ability the the the desire to force

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:18.560
me to vote for one party, which

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:20.800
basically takes away all my power.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.639
That's effectually what it does. If I

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.839
agree to say this is the worst thing in

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:26.160
the world, I essentially have given up

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:28.560
my vote. My vote is not for you. My vote

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.160
is for these two issues. The second

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.920
reason they don't care is because

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.279
somehow no one has empathy with any of

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.800
those people because no one none of us

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:37.760
really deal with those people. At

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.240
Palunteer, we are on the side of

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.000
workingclass Americans. We support

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.079
people who go to the military. We save

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.720
their lives. We bring them home safer.

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:49.759
Our AI actually makes workers more

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.279
wealthy, more valuable. And the 10 to 15

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:53.519
million people that love me despite

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:54.800
what's written, half of them made a lot

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.480
of money on us. And you know what

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.240
they're like? They're like people like

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.680
me who think, you know what, we have to

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.399
do better. Of course, we have to do

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.759
better.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:03.279
>> What do What do you say to this then?

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:05.040
Take me out of it. Take the media out of

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:06.480
it. There's a group of 13 former

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.720
Palunteer employees who wrote an open

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.240
letter to you and they stated, quote,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.079
that Palunteer's leadership has

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:18.000
abandoned its founding ideals.

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:19.920
We have 5,000 ex-perarians and 4,000

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.560
current Palunteerians.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:25.120
And by the way, we encourage a culture

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.040
of disagreement, which you know exists.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.560
Anyone can come visit us. You'll find

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.959
half the people disagreeing with me at

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.680
least on any issue. But I just want to

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:36.320
say we have 5,000 exp Palanteerians. You

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.839
have 13. Half of whom were like in the

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.279
humanities department of Palunteer,

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:41.360
which is a little bit like being in the

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:42.959
printing press part of New York Times. A

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.000
very important part, but no one's really

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:48.560
listening to your opinion. So it's like

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.800
it's yeah, you know, if you if you have

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.800
an organization, I'll tell you what, a

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.279
lot of Palunteerians Palunteerians are

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.040
mostly uncomfortable. Most Palunteerians

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:57.759
are like you. I Okay, I don't know who

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.720
you are because of course because you're

00:16:57.759 --> 00:17:03.519
an objective journalist, but um they

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.360
broadly are okay with they they like the

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:07.199
work we do in Ukraine. By the way, could

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.319
Europeans finally stick up for us since

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:14.000
we're basically the between us and

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:15.120
Russia? Uh and um but they they're very

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.880
proud of that in general, although

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.160
that's also very controversial in non-

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.000
elite circles. That's important to

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.600
remember. They're pretty okay with

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Israel stuff, especially since a lot of

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.520
the BS written about us on the right

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.799
primarily, not primarily on the left.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.240
that somehow we're doing facial

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:30.320
recognition stuff and we're building a

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.240
database. Any technical person knows

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.039
that's BS. By the way, if you've heard

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.039
that and you believe that, listen to the

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:38.480
person who told you that, do 10 minutes

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:39.440
of research and you'll see who has

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.400
credibility for

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.600
>> speak to that directly though because

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.440
people talk about surveillance. They

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.520
they immediately say surveillance

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.160
palunteer that you are helping the US

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.400
government in a massive surveillance

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.520
program given the amount of data that's

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.520
coming in from all sorts of different

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.039
agencies. First thing before I I will

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.720
absolutely get to that the biggest

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:59.360
misconception about Palunteer is none of

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.760
this Palunteer is an absolute dominant

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.880
juggernaut in US commercial and AI. Our

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.480
pro our revenue grew 121% the most

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.679
important metric in enterprise software.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.559
We have the highest number ever

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:12.480
recorded. It's well over 2x any number

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:14.880
that would be highly respectable. So

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.120
we're like the Michael Jordan on the the

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.720
numbers in US commercial. And that

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.880
really pisses a lot of people off.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.679
That's true. Most of our mic most of our

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.320
money 75% of our revenue comes from

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:28.880
America that's growing 77% and most of

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.280
our market cap comes from that. So like

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.440
we are just crushing it in the most

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.000
meritocratic environment in the world US

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.559
commercial. Okay. So the surveillance

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.240
stuff I you know of course you know

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:41.919
there there's the paleianist version of

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.520
it which you know which is like our

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:45.520
product could never be abused. What is

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.120
true is that we are highly ethical but

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.799
don't believe us on that. the the

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.240
instrument. We are not obviously not

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:52.000
building a database. We're not I mean

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.600
the most absurd one is we've built a

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.440
database in Israel. We're bringing here.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.120
Okay, that is complete nuts. First of

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.640
all, we were in this country from the

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.000
very beginning. And second of all, you

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.320
don't need us to build a database.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.400
That's like, oh, I I'm I'm like I have a

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.160
ruler so I can a ruler and a pencil so I

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.000
can do math. Oh, I got a calculator, you

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.000
know. So, it's just that's like you're

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.080
you're selling your people like corn

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.160
syrup, cornflakes or something. Okay.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.160
So, you get to the big issue. Are we

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.240
building a database that can be used for

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.000
surveillance? No. Okay. But the more

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.440
subtle version is if you're legally

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.760
surveiled, we don't even really work

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.200
heavily with the the FBI or DOJ. Could

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.440
you put the could you put it in our

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.600
product? Yes. It are our enemies

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.600
surveiled using data that goes into our

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.919
product 100%. And I completely support

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.640
that. The most interesting thing about

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:38.559
the lie uh that we are doing this is not

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.160
that our product couldn't be abused. Any

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:42.160
workable technology that's ever been

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.240
built has been abused. Electricity has

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.720
been abused. Gasoline engines have been

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.559
abused. Okay. But our product is the

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.320
single hardest product in the world to

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:54.720
abuse because every single step that you

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.240
take is absolutely transparent. So if

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.000
you want to abuse if you want to use our

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.240
product to abuse human rights, you've

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.840
created a record of you doing it. I can

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.280
tell you and this is the part where you

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.360
can get into the low trust environment

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.559
and you don't have to believe me. the

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.320
the environments that abuse data in this

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:13.760
world mostly sigen meaning from

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.919
satellites have never liked our product

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.080
and we were the first place to act we

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:19.360
are the first and to my extent uh to my

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.400
knowledge only company that said we're

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.400
not going to work in Russia we're not

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.000
going to work in China and by the way on

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.840
the issue everyone would think for

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.080
because they somehow think I'm like only

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.200
care about you know they we were the

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.360
first company to say we would not build

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.760
a Muslim bet database and we ended

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.600
contracts in this country with with

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.280
institutions that were essentially there

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.520
to surveil Muslim Americans.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.799
And the only the primary reason for

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.320
these attacks is on the far left uh

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:48.240
people are like they do not like us

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.480
because we stand for meritocracy

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.640
independent

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.280
of all variables. We stand for the rule

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.600
of law. We stand for competence and we

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.679
we call out the complete that

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.600
that that this okay on the far right

00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:04.159
they don't like us because they think

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.159
I'm somehow a Jewish conspiracy because

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:08.320
two of the four or five co-founders are

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:10.080
Jewish. I'm like okay great you know a

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.000
lot of Jews are successful. It's not all

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:16.960
conspiracy. It is a fact.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.280
Those are just the facts. um you

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.880
mentioned

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.640
>> and I'm a little bit pissed at the New

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.120
York Times honestly but since you and

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.960
the main reason is I believe I believe

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.400
in your if you're listening I believe in

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.159
your mission when you write a

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.720
technically completely illiterate

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:32.400
article you lose a lot of credibility if

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.880
people are technical and that's just a

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.280
fact that article about us being a

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.919
surveillance thing you is like where

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.440
it's all implied what we do yeah but the

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:43.440
problem is you lose credibility with

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.360
anyone who goes on the thing and then

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.440
and that's damaging for our democra Let

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.919
me ask you this question though. Is

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.640
there a red line for you? Meaning if you

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:54.480
saw your software being used in a way

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:58.159
that you genuinely believed was

00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:00.400
unconstitutional or illegal, would you

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:02.640
are there conversations you ever have

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.679
back channel or otherwise where you say,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.640
"Guys, uh, this is not this is not cool.

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:07.919
We're not doing this."

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.840
>> You know, there's a term that was

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:12.720
unfortunately coined called constructive

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.520
engagement. Um, first of all, again, I

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.120
it's we we did not sell our product to

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.720
uh cigarette manufacturers that wanted

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.200
to sell their cigarettes to poor black

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.760
neighborhoods. We pulled the m our

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.200
product from uh in law enforcement

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.360
institutions that were purely doing

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.559
profiling. In certain countries in the

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.120
Latin America, racial profiling is just

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:34.480
part of how they do credit scores. We

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.880
could have made a lot of money on that.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.120
We refused to do it. We've said no to

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.039
many countries across the world. We said

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.799
no to China. We didn't we didn't say no

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:45.360
but we didn't work in in adversarial

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:47.120
countries. So you know like we have like

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.559
there's always have you done this I

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.480
think is the most important and we did

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:52.480
this at points where it was critical and

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.400
our we were in desperate times

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.919
financially. So we did this when it

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.400
absolutely could have crushed our

00:22:55.919 --> 00:23:00.720
country our our our company. So the

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.559
obvious answer is yes. Then there's the

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.039
more subtle answer. All these countries

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:06.720
and people I defend in public like

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:08.880
Israel is a perfect example. I think

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.799
most of the critiques of Israel, not

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.559
all, not all, but a lot of people just

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:14.480
have like

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:16.000
Israel derangement or Jewish derangement

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.679
syndrome. It's like they're like

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.679
hobbyists. It's like they think about

00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:20.960
Jews all day. It's like I don't know. I

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:22.640
grew up in the Jewish community. How

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.799
often do you think about Jews? I don't

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.880
think about Jews very often. So, it's

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:29.280
like, hey, I of course I'm going to

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.280
defend in a way publicly that I can

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.120
assure you privately

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.039
people have less present conversations

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.400
than the one we're having. Like I told I

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:38.480
told the Israeli government from the

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.480
beginning, maximum violence to the

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.080
people organizing violence, minimal

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.520
violence to the people on the front end,

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.799
and I told every single person.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.760
>> Do you think that they lived up to that?

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:48.240
We're going to talk to to Prime Minister

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.039
afternoon.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.159
>> You know, you you you I I I could tell

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:57.159
you I feel that if somewhat

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:57.159
illustration,

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.320
on Israel, on these issues, and on lots

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:04.559
of other things, we'd have a better

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.240
world. or primarily my Democratic party.

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:07.840
You know, it's like, do we really have

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.960
to pretend that it's immoral to have a

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.400
border?

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.159
>> In other words, you don't think that

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.440
they have done it as well as

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:15.919
>> you know, it's well, I'll put it this

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.760
way. In a world where people didn't have

00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:20.080
so much derangement syndrome, I would

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.799
would be a lot more critical in this

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.799
world. I think you have to compare them

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:26.159
to what the competence level of any

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:27.679
other country and you say, yeah, these

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:29.679
things are very hard and brutal and

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:32.320
watching these things happen is very

00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:34.720
difficult. But you know, yeah, I it's a

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.279
very hard world because in the end we

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.080
are in a world where the there there

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:42.240
really aren't high integrity partners on

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.960
any side of the debate. So the minute

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.400
you admit that in public that someone is

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.320
wrong, you're really just serving

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.600
somebody who has no interest in

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.360
advancing the debate at all. They have

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.039
an interest in their party winning,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.840
that's not my interest. My party is an

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:57.679
advant my version is we advance America

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.840
as the superior country in the world and

00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:02.320
we remove a lot of the dysfunction by

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.480
argument in by persuading people which

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.000
I'm notoriously bad at. Palanteer we

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480
believe we're notoriously good at being

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.039
right.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.960
>> Alex, you founded this company um with

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:13.279
>> not at persuading people we're right.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.120
>> We leave that to the New York Times. uh

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:17.440
you you you you co-founded this company

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.120
with Peter Teal and for a long time

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.600
there was a view that Peter uh who's

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.760
been on this stage many times uh was the

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.000
conservative and you were the

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.840
progressive and that that served the

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.480
interests actually of the company in a

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.039
certain way because uh you were

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.919
effectively bipartisan. I'm curious how

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:39.120
you think now now that there's a view

00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:41.679
that you and Peter are allin with this

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.640
with this administration in particular

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:46.720
that if in fact Democrats come to uh

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.320
take over the White House in 28 or 32 or

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.400
whatever it is in the future that that

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.679
will make it more complicated for the

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.880
company.

00:25:51.679 --> 00:25:54.559
>> Well, first of all, I don't think that

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.880
view like most of these views is makes

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:59.520
any sense. I'm an independent. My vote

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.679
is up for grab. If you if you if you are

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.720
willing to talk about having a closed

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:06.559
border and maintaining deterrence, I and

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.919
I so I don't think that's at all true.

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:10.159
And I I will tell you something else

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:11.919
that's true. If the Democrats, my former

00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:13.360
party or current party or however you

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:14.960
want to look at it, ran someone who

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.640
agreed with me, even in private, they

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.919
would win. So, you know, maybe you

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.440
should stop winning in the faculty

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:21.279
lounge and start winning. You know, we

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.799
have a saying we we're apparently not

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:25.200
supposed to say anymore, but we always

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:26.880
said we're we're we're uh hot we're cold

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.320
in the streets and hot in the sheets.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.320
Democratic party should think about that

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.159
one a lot. Okay, let me ask let me ask

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.559
you so um can I ask you a different

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:34.320
question?

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:36.320
>> By the way, let me answer your the more

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.240
the second derivative of your question.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.320
>> We're not doing at Palunteer what's in

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.159
the best interest. We we do in Palunteer

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:46.159
what we think is right. And you know,

00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:48.559
you know, the funny thing is because you

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:50.880
know, of our ability to build, I guess

00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:52.720
the 30th, I think it's like top 20 US

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.559
companies, something like that. And

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.840
we're accelerating in year 20, which no

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:57.520
one has ever done with a lot of stuff no

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.559
one else done. And we are the backbone

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.600
of us to turn. Um, people assume that

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:03.120
we're more, in fact, we have this

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.240
problem at Palanteer. We have people who

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.840
join, they're like, they think they're

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.080
joining a normal company. We're not a

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.440
normal company. We are fighting for what

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.880
we believe and we're putting in a

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.559
product to give the people that agree

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.240
with us a superior position.

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:16.000
>> Okay. So, I want to ask you this. Um,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:20.000
and it's a Trump question. You wrote

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.240
your college thesis on fascism.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.080
There's a view, and I'm curious where

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.200
you land. Do you think that President

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.440
Trump is a fascist?

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.679
>> Of course not. I think that's stupid,

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.360
honestly. And you know what? Again, you

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:34.960
you can go all day on this stuff. It's

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:37.679
it's honestly idiotic. I grew up half my

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.480
life in Germany. I spent time with

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:42.799
actual fascists. I went and talked to

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.200
lots of former Nazis.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:47.679
The the this like we have a democratic

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.480
society and you know he won in a

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:52.880
landslide. I don't see any sign of him

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.320
being look of course I don't agree like

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.120
it's like I I don't know what the point

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.559
of these it's like.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.159
>> Well, the reason I was asking it was

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:59.919
because you did study this. This was

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:01.279
your thesis and there's a lot of people

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:02.799
who have different views about this. I

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.840
was actually ask you let me ask you a

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:06.000
different question but maybe it's

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.000
related. Um you know the US government

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.440
has been taking stakes in lots of

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
different technology companies recently.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.960
>> Okay sorry if you want to with all

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.399
respect I am I am running the most

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.720
important tech company in the world. If

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:20.559
you want to talk about benalities about

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.240
who I support how I support why I

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:23.840
support it you can ask them all day. I'm

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.320
keep answering the same question which

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.159
is I believe your questions basically

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.240
the third derivative of them is I

00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:32.720
transfer all my political power to you

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.760
by by being boxed in the same way the

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.399
Green Party boxes boxes in No let me

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.600
just ask you this so originally the CIA

00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:41.760
do you remember this was an early

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.159
investor in Coutell uh the venture

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.600
capital arm was a an early investor in

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:46.640
Palunteer this is why I'm asking the

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.679
question actually because I think

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.320
there's a lot of people who are looking

00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:51.840
right now at uh sort of the the

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.120
industrial policy of the

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.159
the country is taking stakes in

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.240
businesses that they think are

00:28:54.159 --> 00:28:57.279
important, uh, national security issues

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.120
and the like. And

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:00.159
>> but isn't that a classically social

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.679
democratic view?

00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:03.279
>> Well, maybe it is. But my question to

00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:04.559
you, it was just going to be, you know,

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:06.880
if the White House came to you and said,

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:08.159
"Look, hey, Alex, we really like you. We

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.760
think you're important to this country.

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:11.520
You're a very important part of this,

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.440
and we u if we're going to continue to

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.000
give you these contracts, we want a

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.039
piece of the action." What how you would

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.640
what you would think of that?

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:20.399
>> I mean, we'll cross that road when we

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.799
get there. My understanding is people

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:24.799
who are in dire trouble go to the White

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:27.520
House and ask for money and they say

00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:31.840
we've made terrific business decisions

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:33.919
and we want your help. Why wouldn't the

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.000
American people participate? Like you

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:38.159
know one of the biggest problems if you

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.679
get to okay let's just take what is the

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:40.960
biggest problem in this culture. I'll

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:42.799
tell you the biggest problem. No one

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.320
believes the institutions are credible.

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:45.840
And why don't they believe they're and I

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.240
struggle to to believe they're credible

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.600
too? Because these business leaders make

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:54.240
completely stupid decisions and they get

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.080
bailed out a year later they're getting

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.360
huge bonuses and what do the American

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.679
people get? Nothing. And that's a huge

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.840
problem. Like if you make like So I

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:06.000
think the real version is like I made a

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.600
lot of decisions when we began talking

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.120
annoying each other 10 years ago.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:13.840
Hopefully I'm annoying you as much as 10

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:16.480
years ago. Uh or more. uh when when when

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:19.440
I made a you know this every decision

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:22.159
Palanteer made FDA's

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.880
going public building products no one

00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:26.799
enterprise large data sets going to

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.200
government acknowledging American

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:31.600
superiority being proarritocracy

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.080
launching an AI platform calling into

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.080
question that AI models would actually

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.159
be able to perform without orchestration

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.000
every single one uh every single

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:41.840
ourtology every single one of those was

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.200
viewed as stupid you know What I

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.679
actually have grown to appreciate about

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.240
capitalism, all the people who made the

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:50.399
right decisions went broke, are going

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.320
out of business, or are now have to copy

00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:54.480
us. Microsoft launchtology, everyone

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.760
wants to do FDES. Everyone basically

00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:00.000
copies me and Palanteer. That's what I

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.520
love about this country. If you want to

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.120
make your stupid decisions and then you

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.880
go to the White House and ask for money,

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.720
you should absorb the full risk of that.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.880
And I'll tell you the full risk of that.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.240
Somehow your salary should be capped to

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.640
the point where you make a lot of money

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.240
for the American people. If I I was

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.320
absorbing the full risk of our

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.480
stupidity. You were absorbing the full

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.320
risk of my stupidity by putting me on

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.679
there and knowing all the crazy I

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.520
was going to say. And you're going to

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:26.320
have to sit there and listen to it. And

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.080
you did it. And again, if I Yes. And

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.960
we're both absorbing the full risk of

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:33.760
each other's splendor. At at at the

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.240
moment Yeah. At the moment, at the

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.600
moment where I am wrong, I have to pay

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.880
the price for it. Just like, you know,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.320
you're at the top of your game. Whether

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.600
we want it or not, you're at the top of

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.679
your game. Everybody wants to talk to

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.840
you. Okay. Sometimes that's annoying.

00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:46.960
Okay. I, you know, it's like I was

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.320
talking to you when, you know, there

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.919
were other people above you. Now I'm

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.200
talking to you when no one's above you.

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:55.600
Okay. Now, uh, yeah, it's true. And, uh,

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.559
and, okay, and people think I'm

00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:02.000
moderately successful now. Okay. So, we

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:04.799
at Palanteer absorb the full risk of our

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.720
failure and everyone else should too.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:08.399
And you know, I constantly the critique

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.840
I get in Wall Street is I'm an arrogant

00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:13.919
prick. Okay, great. Well, you know,

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.840
judge me by the accomplishment, the

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:17.360
delta between what I've done and my

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.880
arrogance. That's the definition of

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.640
arrogance. I if you're right a lot,

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.080
maybe asserting that you're right, going

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:27.039
to be right tomorrow is pretty

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:29.679
important. And and when we're not right,

00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:31.279
I pay the price every day. Every day.

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:33.519
That's why we have this incredibly

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:36.960
painful internal structure of flatness.

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:39.600
So I can hear how wrong I am all day.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.399
And we absorb the risk of that. And I

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:45.039
think in this culture, not enough pe

00:32:42.399 --> 00:32:47.360
again, the the only people who pay the

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:50.480
price for being wrong in this culture in

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.519
complete fashion are poor people. the

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:56.080
rest of us somehow outsource all the

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:58.240
times we're wrong and stupid to the

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.159
whole society. But if you're poor and

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.000
you're a soldier or you're poor in the

00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:02.960
ghetto, when you're wrong, you go to

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.760
prison or you die.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.480
>> I got a different question

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.000
>> and no one cares.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.120
>> I got a different question for you.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.159
>> And again, look left and right. The one

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.240
thing I would say to people in the

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:13.919
audience, you know, you you know you a

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.039
lot of you think I'm right and you know

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:19.360
your spouse, your relative, your child,

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:21.679
the person at work would be horrified if

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.600
they knew it. You better speak up

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:25.919
because everyone who thinks I'm

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.919
ridiculous fascist, they're speaking up.

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:29.919
They write about it every day. If you do

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:31.600
not speak up, the people who are

00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:34.399
disagreeing with me or think I'm stupid,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.039
a lot I disagree with myself. So you

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:39.919
have to speak up and you cannot blame

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:41.519
the far-left, far-right idiots. When

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:43.360
they speak up for their views, do you

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:45.200
speak up for your views? Where do you

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.440
tell your colleague? I bet you at the

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.080
New York Times a lot of people read that

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.440
article about us and were ashamed. Did

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.320
you go to your editor and say, "How

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.159
could you write something that's

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.679
technically illiterate?" They guy might

00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:56.720
be a fascist, but this is technically

00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:56.960
illiterate. Let me ask you a different

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.039
question.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.720
>> Did you or didn't you? Because I'm the

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:02.320
only one speaking up. you're gonna get a

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.760
world of technical illiteracy on the

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.080
right, on the left, and in the middle.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.159
>> Alex, help me with this. Um, a lot of

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.200
people come on this stage or or

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.639
publicly, and I think this goes to the

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.639
the issue you're talking about to this

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.079
to to this audience saying, "Speak up."

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:15.679
And they come up on a stage or they go

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:17.119
on television or they talk to a reporter

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:19.359
or whatever it is publicly, and they're

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:21.119
timid. They don't tell you actually what

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:24.000
they think. They've got talking points.

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:26.000
They've got plans. All of that. You

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.359
don't have any of those things.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.800
um you have been willing to say I

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:34.240
genuinely believe and I think the

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.720
audience can see it what you think and

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.320
my question is a do you worry about that

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.119
ever

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:44.079
um and b to the same point when you see

00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:46.399
your peers in the business

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:48.000
not speaking up on these issues not

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:49.599
talking about not just these issues but

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.599
whatever they actually think do you

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:53.760
think we would be in a better world and

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:56.000
do you can you see a world where people

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.200
would actually day exactly what they

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.960
think the way you have.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.760
>> I don't say exactly what I think.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.440
>> You don't?

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.560
>> Well, no. That would get awesome. I

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.240
mean, like, yeah, you just like I don't

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.680
know, but but it's very close.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.839
>> What What are we at here?

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.599
>> I don't know. I avoid the whole personal

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:15.440
stuff as much as I can, but um uh uh but

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:18.800
um the the first of all, let me give you

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:21.599
again the the the I think a lot of these

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:24.400
things are downstream from AI.

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:26.400
I the the people who are not speaking up

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.160
are making huge mistakes. First of all,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.839
you're underestimating your audience.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.440
When you're not saying roughly what you

00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:34.800
think, forget let's get to a mark that's

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:37.200
realistic. 50% 20% of what even 20%

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.280
would be 20 times what's actually

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.960
happening. What the people in the

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.200
audience actually perceive is you're

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.920
lying. Now, they don't know what you're

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.119
lying about. And therefore, they impute

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.839
you're lying about something you're

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:52.079
probably not even lying about. And so I

00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:53.760
have the problem that I hurt I I blow up

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:55.599
things all the time. People quit all the

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.680
time. People are offended. Family

00:35:55.599 --> 00:36:00.480
members stop talking to me on occasion

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:03.280
for years till they discover I'm right.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.800
Uh but uh and then they are even more

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.800
ashamed. And that could take another two

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.599
years. Um it's like uh but if you are

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:14.240
not there's really two problems or two

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:16.400
big problems. One, people impute your li

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.400
you're you're lying because and you're

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.000
not actually lying, but people assume

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.280
someone of your level of intellect does

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.079
not believe the stupid things you're

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:26.960
saying and they then the the biggest

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:29.280
problem is you lose the smartest people

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.040
outside. And the problem that they

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.520
underestimate is you lose the smartest

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.640
people inside because when I'm speaking

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:38.880
here, everyone at Palunteer, current,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.320
past, and present, knows, hey, he's

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.280
speaking, he's doing exactly what he

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.119
does at home,

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.480
>> right? So he's telling me the truth when

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:46.160
he says, "Hey, this I don't believe this

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.480
product's going to work or I" I am

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.000
telling you the truth as far as I

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.640
believe it and I have a history of being

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.640
right and and that's the problem. Now

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.440
there's a societal problem which is that

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.119
we have all the basically obviously

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.880
ridiculous people especially the ones

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:02.320
who do not even know that they're

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.160
ridiculous because there's like some

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.800
kind of you know derangement syndrome

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:09.040
that is abregated their ability to

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.920
think. They speak up all the time and

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.520
they intimidate the rest of us. And

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.760
that's a big problem for our society

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.920
because I'll tell you, we are not living

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.560
in a world in the absence of delivery.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:23.440
If America does not deliver, we will be

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.839
under the rule of that's defined by our

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.520
adversaries. This is just a fact. Let me

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:28.960
ask you this um because we're going to

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.200
run out of time and I just want to talk

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.680
to you about you personally for a moment

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.599
and what this is all about. We're all

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:39.280
watching you uh talk I think very openly

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:42.400
about your views and I want to know

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:45.040
where you think it all comes from. Um

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:48.000
where the energy comes from. Um your

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:50.480
your biographer says it comes from your

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.720
childhood. You grew up dyslexic.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.160
Um you grew up uh to a Jewish

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.119
pediatrician was your father.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:59.119
African-American artist was your mother.

00:37:57.119 --> 00:38:01.359
And I want to know what you think has

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:03.119
led to led to all of this. What's

00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:05.040
driving you?

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:08.160
>> Um, it's very hard to know these

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.079
question answer these questions. Um,

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.599
I mean my parents are extraordinarily

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:14.480
talented.

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:17.040
Um and

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.000
uh to the point where I think most of

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.440
the issues they confronted were just

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.119
everyone says they want to be around

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.480
extraordinarily smart people till

00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:27.680
they're around extraordinarily smart

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.680
people and uh and and everyone thinks

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.000
you know they an interaction with my

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.920
parents will school you on what the

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.800
level of aptitude is in the world and

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:41.280
the rest of my family. Um and uh but I I

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.599
think for me people always write about

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.400
my parents and their background and you

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:49.359
know the far right hates that you know

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.400
we I grew up in a Jewish family and and

00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:55.280
defend Jews

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:58.240
against the most disgusting and obvious

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.560
vehement attacks. Uh, and the far left

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.480
thinks because of my background I should

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.640
somehow give up real progressive thought

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.240
and support ideologies that only hurt

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:10.480
the people they claim to support. Um, I

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.480
I mean I so I think there's a those

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.320
article those ways of thinking don't

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.520
clear a certain level of thought

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.839
philosophically. Um, but and so I tend

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.760
to find them fairly boring and wish the

00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:24.640
world someone else would speak up. The

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:27.520
dyslexia thing has been which I was

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:30.240
totally in the closet about is the

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.800
formative moment of my life and it's

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:36.240
simply because if you are massively

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.480
dyslexic you cannot play a playbook.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.960
There is no playbook a dyslexic can

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.440
master and therefore we learn to think

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:46.000
freely. And so you know one definition

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.079
of dyslexia would be you have there are

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.079
many definitions one definition is that

00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:52.160
I think is a clearing function is you

00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:57.040
have a attenuated

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:59.040
uh relationship to um to to to to text

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.119
meaning a non-dislexic will read the

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.960
text and the text will become them de

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:05.119
facto the more you lead the more the

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.800
more the text becomes you no dyslexic

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:08.240
works that way and so there are huge

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.839
disadvantages honestly I would have cut

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.760
off my arms and legs probably or at

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:14.880
least something to to get rid of the

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.280
dyslexia. But the central advantage is I

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:20.400
process in a way that has very little to

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:24.240
do with what anyone else thinks. And

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:27.440
that that has powered a lot combined

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.040
with obviously obvious aptitude and I

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.200
believe in what we're doing. So we work

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.160
we're very aggressive in making it work.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.000
Um I don't know but I really where it

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.960
comes from but I really believe in the

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.839
primacy of winning not for money which I

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.680
love the freedom of money but because

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:45.520
you know I do think what people will

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.520
believe will be downstream of what has

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.800
worked at some point in the future and I

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.800
believe in what we're doing.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.079
>> Let me ask you this um and I want to

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.480
know whether you think this drives you.

00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:56.560
Uh you told a story. Your mother uh

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.480
passed away from cancer and you were

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.160
interviewed. Uh just

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.800
>> No, wasn't she didn't That's wrong. But

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.079
>> that's wrong.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.240
>> She didn't pass away.

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:06.319
>> No. Oh my goodness. So luckily

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.119
>> I don't know why uh why that note said

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:10.079
that.

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:11.839
>> Um I hope she didn't. Uh I thought you

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:12.560
were talking about this the jeweler.

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:14.319
>> Yeah.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.200
>> Who helped your mother when she had

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:18.400
nothing.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:21.280
>> But I was struck by this. I was struck

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.319
by u a quote where there was a jeweler

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.720
who helped your mother.

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:27.359
>> When my parents got divorced, my mom had

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.280
no money and there was a a very kind

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:32.319
family that took her in.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.000
>> But you and and but you said this about

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:36.640
life and the and the jeweler helping

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.680
your mother and you said in general

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.440
people don't help you. And I I I

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.520
remember watching you say that and I

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:45.440
thought is that what's driving this?

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.839
meaning this view about how you think

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:51.040
the rest of the world views all of each

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:52.800
other helping each other or not that

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.319
that the world is actually not trying to

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:58.240
help you.

00:41:54.319 --> 00:42:00.000
>> I do not believe it's accurate to say

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.520
the world will help you and I my

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.880
grandfather used to say be care be

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:08.880
careful who you help they'll never

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:11.520
forgive you. Um and uh I yeah I think

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:14.160
the more you want the true progressive

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.240
position is obviously help someone to

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.240
help themselves and I do believe the the

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.680
negative side of helping people I mean

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.520
there's a positive side of helping

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.280
people but the negative side of helping

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.960
people is you are conveying the idea

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.560
that they need your help and they need

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:32.640
it in perpetuity which is dehumi de

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:36.560
dehumanizes and de de takes away agency

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:39.200
from them. But I yeah, I do believe that

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:42.319
um you know, America

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:45.599
and strong individuals,

00:42:42.319 --> 00:42:48.480
realistic individuals recognize you are

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:51.200
largely on your own. And the more you

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.520
recognize that, the better we will be as

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.359
a society and a world. And that's why

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.599
I'm very skeptical of like all these

00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:59.680
like, you know, international whatever.

00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:01.920
It it's all a way of curtailing and

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.400
constraining the obvious fact that some

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.800
cultures are superior. We live we live

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.440
in the superior culture as a culture

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.359
that defends our right to argue, defends

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.280
our right to back that up with arms.

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:15.839
Defends our right to privacy. So the

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.760
first, second, and fourth amendment. I

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:19.440
believe Palanteer and I are fully

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.200
aligned with the first, second, and

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.760
fourth amendment. No one believes the

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.520
fourth amendment, but it's arguably as

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.640
important as the others. The first

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:32.160
amendment was put first for a reason and

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:35.440
it we are we protect individuals in this

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:38.400
country and our constitution derives

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:41.200
that protection from a higher force God.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:46.640
It is different than any other country

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:50.880
in the world. And the basis of that is

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:53.040
protecting our agency as humans. And why

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.200
do we have that agency? because it is

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.119
somehow magical in the in an artistic

00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:01.839
sense or maybe in a religious sense it's

00:43:57.119 --> 00:44:04.160
somehow divine and that agency is how we

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:07.520
help others and how we help ourselves

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.760
and uh and if you expect people to do

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.280
more than that now some people do the

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.280
the family I don't know if I should say

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.280
their name because I don't want them to

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.720
get protesters uh although I've had a

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.240
lot of people asking can they go buy

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.640
jewelry there especially people I've

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.119
made very wealthy and I'm proud of that

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.880
um there are people who manage to help

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:28.960
at key moments and those people I have

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.400
great reverence for and you will see in

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.359
your life that there are very few of

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.599
them like I had this adviser I when I

00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:37.520
went to we transferred into a magnet

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:39.040
school at Central and I got you know

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:41.280
it's very American you're already at an

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.800
elite school I got an IQ test and she's

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.920
like you know what are your grades and

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.000
in any case she's like you should have

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.079
the best grades in the and like she

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.680
intervened and took care of me and I

00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:51.440
revered that and I hope people at

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.280

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.359
elite educational brand in the world

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:58.960
currently. And if you have as defined by

00:44:57.359 --> 00:45:00.560
it's like being at Harvard or Yale in

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.480
the 50s. If you are at Palanteer, you

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.079

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.319
being exceedingly difficult.

French saying

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.000
