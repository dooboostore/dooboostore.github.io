WEBVTT

00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.560
- I know my heart is kind.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.940
I know I'm intelligent.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.150
I know that I'm talented,
and I know that I have a lot

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.670
to offer outside of just appearances.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.910
So when you get to a place in your life

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.579
where you can appreciate that,
it really empowers you, yeah.

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.996
[bright orchestra music]

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.660
Today, we are getting glammed
with my incredible team

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.490
for Vogue World to Hollywood.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.760
Hollywood and film, I've
embraced it since a young age.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.290
It's been a part of my life.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.590
The dreams that are made here,
the stories that are told,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.990
it's all so inspiring to me.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.000
I came to Hollywood at 15,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.790
no confidence at all
when I first got here.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.810
I had confidence in my talent,
but I think body image,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.540
beauty, the standards are
really high in Hollywood

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.210
and moving here at such a young
age kind of played on that.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.600
Something that really
helps me are affirmations,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.790
doing affirmations in the mirror.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.680
When I'm going through a difficult time,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.590
I'll just write something really
sweet and loving to myself

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.750
and that way I read it every day,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.730
and if you practice it in the mirror,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.302
it helps you believe it more.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:11.820
[camera clicks]

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.080
This is Fitch.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.430
He does my hair.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.100
- Hi.
- This is Loftjet,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.440
Makeup, and Natalie.
- Hi.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.600
- She is doing my nails.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.720
LJ and Fitch and I have been
working together, I think,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.010
since March,
- March.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.270
- and Natalie and I have been
working together since 2019,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.584
- [Natalie] Yeah, I think so.

00:01:32.584 --> 00:01:34.170
- six years.
- Six great years. [laughs]

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.823
- [Demi] Six wonderful years.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.350
- When I saw the dress, I was like,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.900
I see this girl being like
the lead actress in a movie

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.340
and she's running on the beach

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.490
and this, you know, she's been
there for days just tanning,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.330
and she's in love.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.700
- Romantic.
- Romantic, romance is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.170
like the key word for today.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.930
- It's movie magic.
- Exactly, we're acting

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.880
like we're on holiday.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.530
- Today, we're gonna do something up.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.350
So the pins are just
kind of keeping it pc,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.850
we're doing something that's
ethereal, kind of like dewy.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.700
The texture's gonna be
like borderline wet.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.950
- Since I've started working with Fitch

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.900
and embracing my natural hair texture,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.550
I let my hair air dry.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.190
It's voluminous, it's big, it's sexy,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.440
and it gives me confidence.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.250
- Just incorporating
health maintenance just

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.950
for the integrity of her hair just kind

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.980
of keeping the natural vibe
while also using products

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.020
to keep her hair like really healthy.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.970
- [Natalie] We're in our
squoval era right now.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.930
- Yes, I was an almond-shaped
girly for a minute,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.350
but now
- Yeah, switch the shit up.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.180
- I've been loving this shape.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.184
- [Producer] What is it called?

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:44.138
- Squoval, so it's in between.
- Squoval, square oval.

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.506
- [Natalie] Yeah. [laughs]

00:02:46.506 --> 00:02:47.579
- Sorry I took that from you. [laughs]

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.829
- No it's okay.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.110
Yeah, so it's a square
shape but rounded corners.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.760
So it's a little different
than your standard square.

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:59.677
[gentle jazz music]

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.060
- Outfit that I'm wearing is
kind of got this Victorian vibe

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.840
to it, and it's something that
you would see in film and,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.313
but with a modern twist.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.740
- This is a Ludovic de Saint turn in look,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.440
and it's spring summer of '26.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.200
Everything we've been doing
has been kind of like sexy

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.010
but sleek, and this kind of
is a little bit more frilly

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.140
and outside of the world.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.720
So it felt like a fun event to
do it for since it's centered

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.553
around film.

00:03:34.553 --> 00:03:37.620
So Fab, when you'll see
it on Demi, is that this,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.720
it looks just like kind
of like a simple blouse,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.940
but it's really snatched and tailored.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.483
So it's kind of like the
fit is pretty impeccable,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.870
and then, yeah, again,
like the lingerie elements

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.130
have been kind of a consistent

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.770
throughout the it's-not-that-deep era.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.770
ARAKS, we've just been
kind of obsessed with some

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.603
of their pieces.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.533
It comes in like really cute colors,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.220
and yeah, we just wanted
to keep it monochromatic.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.110
There's like a maybe a switch up.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.130
I don't know if we're gonna see it,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.200
but I think it'll be in probably this.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.640
So I think the coolest part
about this whole cycle has been

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.460
that she's been so open, and
I feel like you can really see

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.490
how happy she is, and I feel
like with that, came a lot

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.230
of like freedom and openness.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.230
So I feel like kind of
helping her step into that

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.300
and like how do we like show that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.190
through the close and show,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.860
and I think if you go on
Twitter, her fans, I feel like,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.300
even notice it too.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.330
I feel like it's been like
a very like fulfilling thing

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.723
to see how happy and like
present and confident she is.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.660
So shoes with the elongated
toe, these have kind

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.430
of become like a staple for her.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.823
She wore them all during Paris
Fashion Week pretty much.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.100
- [Producer] Those look hard to walk in.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.180
- I know.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.320
When I first started working with her,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.150
I feel like she wasn't
too much of a heels girl,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.590
but now I feel like she's a pro.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.260
So I feel like, yeah,
these are pretty intense,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.360
but they're beautiful.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.860
I kind of want to try this insane diamond,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.180
pretty short necklace.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.520
Probably gonna be like a simple like huggy

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.233
or something on the ear.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.380
I don't think anything
should be added just

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.680
because people feel like
there should be more.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.142
Yes, it's so good.

00:05:28.142 --> 00:05:31.673
- This is the final look. [laughs]

00:05:31.673 --> 00:05:32.506
- I love it.

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:34.303
It's so good.

00:05:34.303 --> 00:05:35.310
- I love them.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.650
- We did a little last minute switch up,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.800
but I feel like it's fab.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.040
I feel like it's a little
darker, a little moody

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.500
or the black makes it
kind of more contemporary

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.850
and cooler, I feel like.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.878
So it was actually your idea.

00:05:46.878 --> 00:05:48.630
- [laughs] Yes.
- It was her idea.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.230
- I just thought the black
was a little bit sexier.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.520
What movie would I be in?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.660
I don't know.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.278
- [Chris] I feel like it's
like Pride and Prejudice,

00:05:56.278 --> 00:05:57.117
- That's what I was going
- running and running down,

00:05:57.117 --> 00:05:58.890
- to say, yes.
- like kicking

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.968
off the heel like,
- Yes.

00:05:59.968 --> 00:06:01.466
- you know, that vibe.

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:02.850
[upbeat jazz music]

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.940
- The image of it feels
very soft and feminine

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.640
and it just is very beautiful.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.070
I love it, and I love the body of it.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.942
It gives me a nice shape, snatched.

00:06:12.942 --> 00:06:14.880
- Snatched, like it already was snatched,

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.730
and we like took it in a
little more, but it's like,

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.130
I feel like it just
looks powerful and soft

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.333
at the same time, which is very mature.

00:06:29.517 --> 00:06:32.184
[camera clicks]

00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:03.457
[group cheers]
- Yay, love you.

00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:06.509
- Say hi to everyone.
- Another one.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.426
- Have fun.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.220
- Thank you.

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:25.267
Thank you so much, Vogue.

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:28.184
[kisses] Love you.
