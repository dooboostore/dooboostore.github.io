00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:10.396
In just six years,

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:13.556
Argentina, my beautiful home country,

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.756
went from barely having
renewable energy on its grid

00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:19.156
to one where on some days

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:23.756
nearly 40 percent of its electricity
comes from wind and solar.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.276
And this happened in a country

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:30.036
globally recognized
for its political and economic crisis.

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:34.636
Home of a world-class oil and gas industry

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:37.796
with the fourth-largest shale oil reserve

00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:41.116
and the second-largest
shale gas reserve in the world.

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:44.596
You might be wondering,
how was that possible?

00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:47.436
And how can we replicate this
all over the world?

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:50.476
I'm going to tell you how.

00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:54.436
I spent my entire career
making renewables a reality.

00:00:54.476 --> 00:00:56.556
I worked in the private energy sector,

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.676
in government, in the third sector,

00:00:58.716 --> 00:00:59.876
and after many years,

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:02.476
I learned that the key to making
the energy transition

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:03.996
work in emerging markets

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:07.836
all comes down to helping investors
protect their investments

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:10.436
and building trust where there's not any.

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:12.476
It's basic.

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:15.236
It's a step one of real-world economics.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.316
But keep that framing
in your mind for a while

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:20.476
and let's look at Argentina
as our case study.

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:22.876
When I was starting out
thinking about renewables,

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:25.116
I was always asking myself two things.

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:27.556
Why were we using fossil fuels

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:30.476
instead of our incredible
renewable resources?

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:34.596
And why was my country
experiencing recurrent economic crises?

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:37.716
And I found that both
questions were connected.

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:41.636
Fossil fuels are easy, practical

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:44.876
and for a long time
has been the obvious choice.

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:47.236
A lot of concentrated energy,

00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:48.836
just dirty.

00:01:48.836 --> 00:01:50.716
But who really cares, right?

00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:52.316
On the other side,

00:01:52.316 --> 00:01:54.916
renewables require
significant upfront investment

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:57.516
for them to produce
clean energy for decades

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.556
at almost zero operational cost,

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:02.636
which makes them competitive
against fossil fuels,

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:04.676
but only in the long term.

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:07.596
Long-term investments
are really the challenge

00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:10.196
in risky markets like Argentina.

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:13.996
As for the second question,
the economic crisis, get this.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:16.916
I always knew that this
was because of politics

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:19.316
and what I call mismanagement.

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:21.756
But there was something else there.

00:02:21.796 --> 00:02:22.996
Energy.

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:26.196
Argentina is a country super rich
in natural resources,

00:02:26.236 --> 00:02:29.196
but we've been importing
fossil fuels for decades.

00:02:29.236 --> 00:02:30.396
And of course,

00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:34.916
fuels that had to be paid for
with money that we never had.

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:37.156
So it became clear to me

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:40.076
that if we really want
to make the energy transition work,

00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:41.676
we have to finally find a way

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:44.196
to get private investment
into the long term.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.716
And if we could do it,

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:47.556
we can tackle both things at once.

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:48.756
Climate change

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:53.876
and the economic strain
of spending hard currency we don't have

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:56.916
in importing energy
we don't actually need.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:03.116
Argentina has tried four times since 1990
to develop its renewable resources

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.356
and failed each time because, of course,

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:08.556
the transition from
fossil fuels to renewables

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:13.196
doesn’t happen because someone like me,
here, on a TED Talk, says it should.

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:16.036
It happens because it is convenient.

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:17.516
And convenient,

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:19.156
particularly in emerging markets,

00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:23.276
means economically viable
for both the buyer and the seller.

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:26.276
And here's where I found that my country

00:03:26.316 --> 00:03:29.796
was one of the hardest countries
where to invest long term in the world.

00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:31.316
But why?

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:32.476
Because historically,

00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:35.596
we had the habit of changing
the rules halfway through.

00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:38.716
Can we imagine what it means

00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:40.756
to convince an investor to put their money

00:03:40.756 --> 00:03:44.276
into something that spans
multiple administrations,

00:03:44.316 --> 00:03:45.716
four, five?

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:50.836
Listen, we have five presidents
in ten days in the early 2000s.

00:03:50.836 --> 00:03:53.156
(Laughter)

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:54.636
It's just too risky.

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:58.436
So the rule here
is a short-term investment rule.

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.836
And when you want to build
your wind or solar farm

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:03.156
and get your investment back
in only a few years,

00:04:03.156 --> 00:04:06.516
the result is that the unit
of energy is too expensive

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:09.356
and is not competitive
against fossil fuels.

00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:10.636
So here we go.

00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:12.636
Renewables are expensive.

00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:15.676
Of course not.

00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:17.716
But we need to build them
in the long term,

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:19.276
there's no other way to do it.

00:04:20.356 --> 00:04:22.036
So I decided to try to change that,

00:04:22.036 --> 00:04:24.116
and I started working
from the civil society

00:04:24.116 --> 00:04:25.676
in creating a legal framework,

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:27.396
a political umbrella,

00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:29.796
that would allow
all the factions in my country

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:32.516
to rally behind one single cause.

00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:36.756
We needed to develop our incredible
renewable resources,

00:04:36.796 --> 00:04:39.276
consume less fossil fuels,

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:41.636
and save on our energy balance.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.116
We needed a program
that cannot be easily undone

00:04:44.156 --> 00:04:46.116
by a change in government control.

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:49.396
We needed a national cross-party policy

00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:53.036
in which everyone agrees
that renewables must happen,

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:54.716
not because [they] are clean

00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:57.596
or green or fancy,

00:04:57.636 --> 00:04:59.916
but because [they] are convenient.

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:03.876
It took me huge effort, frustration
more than two years,

00:05:03.876 --> 00:05:05.036
but I did it.

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:09.836
We managed to convince
almost every member in Congress

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:12.356
to support a national
renewable energy law.

00:05:12.356 --> 00:05:16.276
(Applause)

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:19.756
Something that, as you can imagine,
felt nearly impossible

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:22.836
in a country marked
by deep political polarization

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:25.476
and the oil and gas industry
fighting us at every step.

00:05:25.476 --> 00:05:30.236
But we did it because
the argument was clear, easy.

00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:34.196
It would be economically beneficial
for the nation if we started

00:05:34.196 --> 00:05:36.156
by demonstrating to investors

00:05:36.156 --> 00:05:39.996
a true political consensus
and a long-term unity.

00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:42.596
Long story short, the law was passed by

00:05:42.596 --> 00:05:45.956
with 94 percent of support
in both chambers.

00:05:45.996 --> 00:05:47.156
Historic.

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:50.396
(Applause)

00:05:50.436 --> 00:05:51.636
This is me.

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:53.476
(Laughter)

00:05:54.516 --> 00:05:56.516
And with that in my hand,

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.876
I moved to the next phase
of the plan: implementation.

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:03.676
I had the privilege of being invited
to join the executive branch,

00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:05.796
the Ministry of Energy,

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:09.556
to design a program that can really
change the course of our energy future.

00:06:09.596 --> 00:06:11.436
And I knew where to start.

00:06:11.436 --> 00:06:14.836
We had to improve the credit rating
of the energy program

00:06:14.836 --> 00:06:18.196
and shift it out of the credit
rating of the country.

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:19.796
Because by doing so,

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.356
we would bring international
capital to the game

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:26.156
and prices would go down from A to B,

00:06:26.196 --> 00:06:29.876
making renewables competitive
against fossil fuels.

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:33.436
So we designed a unique scheme
of investment guarantees,

00:06:33.436 --> 00:06:37.036
something that I love to call
the worst-case scenario waterfall.

00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:38.916
It consists of three steps.

00:06:39.356 --> 00:06:42.356
The first one, what we call
the energy payment guarantee.

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:45.716
It is basically a fund,
established in advance by the government

00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:47.596
to pay the seller of the energy,

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:50.796
like the investors behind
the wind or the solar farm,

00:06:50.836 --> 00:06:53.996
for any payment that the buyer,

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:55.516
like the utility,

00:06:55.556 --> 00:06:57.596
cannot pay for whatever reason.

00:06:58.156 --> 00:06:59.316
Interesting.

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:02.076
But we knew that this was not enough.

00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:03.996
Because we know

00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:07.556
that the government of Argentina
has frequently halted currency conversions

00:07:07.556 --> 00:07:10.476
and restricted money transfers abroad
in past economic crises.

00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:14.516
So we had to offer an extra layer
of protection to the investors.

00:07:14.876 --> 00:07:16.916
We structured a second step,

00:07:16.956 --> 00:07:19.476
what we call the early termination
payment guarantee.

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:22.996
We structured treasury notes
that we granted to investors in advance

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:24.996
before they commit their investment.

00:07:25.036 --> 00:07:28.716
We told them that no matter
what the government decides to do,

00:07:28.756 --> 00:07:31.036
they will get their investment back.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.196
That's beautiful.

00:07:33.076 --> 00:07:35.956
But still, something was missing here.

00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:41.716
Because we knew that we needed to bring
international capital to the game.

00:07:42.076 --> 00:07:44.356
So far, we've been
protecting the investors

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:46.236
from problems within Argentina,

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:49.276
but not from Argentina
defaulting on its obligations

00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:52.316
as unfortunately had happened in the past.

00:07:52.316 --> 00:07:55.116
And if there's something
money has, it's memory.

00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:58.556
So we decided to offer
a third-step guarantee,

00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:00.876
what we call the international backstop,

00:08:00.916 --> 00:08:03.556
to backstop the obligations
of the sovereign government.

00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:07.556
We negotiated a 750 million dollars
with the World Bank,

00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:10.476
one of the least risky
institutions in the world.

00:08:10.516 --> 00:08:13.436
In other words, we told investors

00:08:13.436 --> 00:08:16.676
that no matter what's going on,
they will get their investment back

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:18.236
in the currency of their choice,

00:08:18.236 --> 00:08:20.236
wherever in the world they would like.

00:08:22.396 --> 00:08:24.636
So now, it's a different thing, right?

00:08:24.996 --> 00:08:29.076
So the water of international
finance could start flowing.

00:08:29.556 --> 00:08:32.996
But what does this really mean
in practical terms?

00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:34.676
Before I took office,

00:08:34.716 --> 00:08:37.076
Argentina was negotiating contracts

00:08:37.076 --> 00:08:40.476
at the 350-dollar range
in the solar business.

00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:43.356
Long-term contracts
but short-term view.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.916
Super expensive.

00:08:44.956 --> 00:08:47.716
And of course, not competitive
at all against fossil fuels.

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:49.236
Not convenient.

00:08:49.556 --> 00:08:51.196
In less than six months,

00:08:51.196 --> 00:08:53.556
we brought prices down
by a factor of seven,

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:55.276
to the 50-dollar range.

00:08:55.676 --> 00:09:00.036
(Applause)

00:09:00.596 --> 00:09:04.436
We brought 11 billion dollars
into the economy.

00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:05.996
In the wires,

00:09:06.036 --> 00:09:09.556
more than 200 projects all
around the country

00:09:09.556 --> 00:09:11.156
are making today

00:09:11.156 --> 00:09:13.476
a place where on some days,

00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:17.276
nearly 40 percent of its electricity
comes from wind and solar.

00:09:17.316 --> 00:09:18.476
And drum roll, please.

00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:20.276
The country --

00:09:20.276 --> 00:09:21.516
(Applause)

00:09:21.556 --> 00:09:23.396
is saving today

00:09:23.436 --> 00:09:26.716
over two billion dollars
in hard currency per year.

00:09:26.756 --> 00:09:30.796
This is more than 40 billion dollars
in the life of the assets,

00:09:30.796 --> 00:09:34.796
equivalent to the entire debt
that the country has with the IMF,

00:09:34.796 --> 00:09:36.956
the largest in the world by far.

00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:41.796
(Applause)

00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:45.716
More than 300 million tons of CO2 avoided.

00:09:46.076 --> 00:09:49.836
This is the real impact
of what a well-structured

00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:52.396
and trustworthy program can offer.

00:09:52.756 --> 00:09:56.636
But I knew that this was not
only a problem affecting Argentina.

00:09:56.676 --> 00:10:02.116
More than 70 percent of the countries
in the world suffer about the same.

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:05.316
So I decided to leave
the government a few years ago

00:10:05.356 --> 00:10:07.516
and with the support
of Climate Breakthrough,

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:10.156
I created a nonprofit organization

00:10:10.156 --> 00:10:12.956
to support governments in emerging markets

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:15.876
with the design and implementation
of renewables at scale.

00:10:16.756 --> 00:10:18.196
I wanted to offer others

00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:20.636
what I would have loved
to have when I took office,

00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:21.996
and I didn't have.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.796
Someone, a real partner,

00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:25.996
that can help me design the path forward,

00:10:26.036 --> 00:10:27.716
craft the documents with me.

00:10:27.756 --> 00:10:31.756
Someone that can give me access
to a world-class team of experts

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:33.956
with real, hands-on experience

00:10:33.956 --> 00:10:36.956
in structuring projects
all around the world,

00:10:36.996 --> 00:10:40.076
and particularly, renewable energy
projects in emerging markets.

00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:42.156
Someone that can give me tools,

00:10:42.196 --> 00:10:45.556
concrete tools, like the iTrust,
our guarantee fund,

00:10:45.596 --> 00:10:47.796
established and ready to use.

00:10:48.396 --> 00:10:52.356
It is called RELP, in short
for real and possible.

00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:56.156
And we work across emerging markets
in Southeast Asia,

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.836
supporting governments in Africa,

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:59.916
in Latin America and the Caribbean.

00:10:59.956 --> 00:11:02.916
And we won't stop until we see renewables

00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:05.796
in every single wire and beyond.

00:11:05.836 --> 00:11:10.436
(Cheers and applause)

00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:13.916
The key is to create stability,

00:11:13.916 --> 00:11:15.756
build trust

00:11:15.756 --> 00:11:17.916
and design programs

00:11:17.956 --> 00:11:19.996
that can really make renewables

00:11:19.996 --> 00:11:22.116
not just the right thing to do,

00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:25.396
but the most convenient thing
to do everywhere.

00:11:25.436 --> 00:11:26.556
Thank you.

00:11:26.596 --> 00:11:31.076
(Cheers and applause)
