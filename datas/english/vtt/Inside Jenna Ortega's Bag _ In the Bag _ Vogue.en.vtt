WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
- I used to do this on set.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.630
Because sometimes the
spiders get a little scared.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.360
If you configure yourself
in the right way,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.060
they'll start to make webs in your hand.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.893
Isn't that crazy?

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:13.056
[gentle lively music]

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.710
First item, it's my Death Grips hat

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.260
that probably needs a wash from Praying.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.970
I love Death Grips.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.490
We thought that they
broke up and they didn't.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.813
I think they're still going.

00:00:24.813 --> 00:00:26.520
But I did see them in London.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.080
I think I was actually shooting for Dior,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.430
and I called my cast mate

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.960
who was playing my love
interest at the time,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.100
and I was trying to get to know him.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.120
I took him to a Death Grips show,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.500
but I don't think he
listened to Death Grips.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.631
So, he was really confused
by all the head banging.

00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:40.230
It was the sweatiest venue
I've ever been in, in my life.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.913
Like, everyone was sleek.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.513
My wallet, it's just what
I use to pay for things.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.880
I don't know what this is.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.053
It's a special coin.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.660
Is this a British coin?

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.920
I don't know.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.485
Guys, I have a pound.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:56.070
Two pounds. I have two pounds.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.200
Irish permit, residency permit.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.610
They let me live in Ireland.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.660
Yeah, nothing exciting.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.336
Dingy passport 'cause I'm
getting on a flight right now.

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:05.490
I'm going to London.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.556
I'm shooting a movie right
now with J.J. Abrams,

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:12.570
Glen Powell, Samuel
Jackson, and Emma Mackey.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.583
And tomorrow, we're shooting the big,

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:17.520
huge third act of the film.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.810
So, we'll see how that goes.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.520
Someone showed me these on
"Wednesday" season 2 in Ireland.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.253
These Tea Tree Therapy Cinnamon
Toothpicks changed my life.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.410
[toothpicks rattling]

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.243
Can I be honest?

00:01:29.243 --> 00:01:30.960
I think I stole this during a fitting

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.066
with my stylist, Enrique.

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:32.899
I don't know.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.227
I like it 'cause it's got
this, like, red interior,

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:38.117
and I like the black and red combo.

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:41.700
Sunglass case, except my
sunglasses aren't in it.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.770
They're down at the hair and makeup tent.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.800
But I've got these dirty
Barton Perreira glasses

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.790
that I wear all the time.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.546
And I really liked it when I had red hair

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.510
because they match perfectly.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.000
But now they don't really do me any good,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.960
but they're still really cute.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.730
I also stole these during a fitting.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.950
I actually had so much fun
during the Vogue Mexico shoot.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.720
I'm a bit jet lagged and delirious,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.150
and it's either the best
or worst time to get me.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.352
And today felt very playful and easy,

00:02:05.352 --> 00:02:09.930
and the entire team was so
sweet and good at what they do.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.280
I love a quick shoot when you know,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.703
when we know we have
the photo or the image,

00:02:12.703 --> 00:02:15.270
we move on and that's kind of what it was.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.940
Journal, I don't have
anything exciting in here yet.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.171
No dreams or anything.

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.370
What do I have?

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.370
Oh, I'm having to write something
for this J.J. Abrams film.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.200
It's a bunch of things
that maybe we'll use,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.250
maybe we won't use,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.103
but it's also just nice to
get into character sometimes

00:02:31.103 --> 00:02:32.774
and just have ideas.

00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:36.610
But I'm a huge journal person.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.377
I try to brighten it every day.

00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:40.740
I think it's good for the brain.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.124
It's not really about my daily life,

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:45.360
but more so just kind
of what I'm thinking.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.760
I have a tendency to
overthink things to the point

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.910
where I just completely
mutilate the initial intent

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.617
of whatever the thought or idea was.

00:02:53.617 --> 00:02:55.830
So, it's nice just to get back to base.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.070
It's not overthink anything
and see what comes out.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.551
Writing is very big for me.

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.410
[journal thumping]

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.430
All right.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.540
I just started reading

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.640
Ottessa Moshfegh's "Death In Her Hands."

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.200
It was recommended to me by a friend.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.760
I think I'll be away
from home for a while.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.917
So, I just wanted a bunch
of new things to read

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:12.447
and new authors.

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:14.940
So, I'm very excited by this actually.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.400
It's about a woman who
it's just done a quiet walk

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.114
with her dog and then
stumbles upon a dead body.

00:03:20.114 --> 00:03:21.854
So, I'm really enjoying it so far.

00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:24.090
I am about to get on this flight,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.014
so I'm hoping to get
through a lot more of it.

00:03:26.014 --> 00:03:26.847
[book thumping]

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:28.620
I try to read as much as I possibly can.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.580
I was always that way.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.380
I would get in trouble
when I was a kid for,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.390
it would be past bedtime
and my parents would come in

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.950
and I would try to turn
my reading light off

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.150
as quick as I possibly could

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.190
just because I don't wanna get in trouble.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.010
These, I actually just got
from my makeup artist, Melanie.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.800
Persephenie smelling
salts for mental clarity.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.120
It's a bit awkward to do

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.160
because if people don't
know what you're doing,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.069
it's a bit suspicious, but it's just salt

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.330
and it feels like a shot of espresso.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.070
I get brain fog really easily.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.108
I get very confused when
I'm tired and whatnot.

00:03:55.108 --> 00:03:58.320
So, it's actually really
beneficial for me.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.470
Oh, I have a harmonica in my bag.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.780
I thought that I was gonna
need this for the job

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.613
that I was doing

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.140
and then I showed up
and I think we're going

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.180
in a very different creative direction.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.450
So, I've been practicing
the harmonica for a bit.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.563
Also, I don't have the
cool BJ Blues harmonica.

00:04:15.563 --> 00:04:17.523
I don't know where I got, Easttop?

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.620
Beautiful guy.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.120
And sometimes you can... [inhales deeply]

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.994
Wait.

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:24.120
[soft music]

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.916
So, me and my friends
sometimes when we're talking.

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:29.008
[soft music]

00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:31.811
And I think that's a much
more, like, nonchalant,

00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:33.820
easy way to play a harmonica,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.360
and people should probably
do that more often.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.860
Because if I saw someone doing that

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.817
at a little bar or something,

00:04:39.817 --> 00:04:41.266
I would think they were probably cool.

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:42.270
What else do I have?

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.590
Well, I mean it's just my phone.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.450
Wires are always attached.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.530
I have two different headphones

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.896
because they have different purposes.

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:51.600
So for example, like the
job that I'm on right now,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.270
I wear a wig, so I can't
put something over my head.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.250
So, when I'm walking
around set or you know,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.220
waiting in between takes,
I'll use my wired headphones.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.605
Also, sometimes it looks
better with the outfit.

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:04.470
I hate to say it, but it's true.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.499
And then, these are heavy duty.

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:10.060
I'm on a flight. I cannot
hear you with these things on.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.310
My last one's broke,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.620
so I actually had to get the updated ones

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.417
and it was a really tragic death for me.

00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:17.130
But these ones are doing all right so far.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.450
And they're pretty comfortable.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.290
What am I listening to?

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.360
Well, should we actually check my Spotify?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.190
I know for sure I'm going through

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.100
a really big Dean Blunt phase right now.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.900
I have Aphex Twin on here.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.420
I have Arthur Russell.
A lot of Arthur Russell.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.129
I feel like for spring, summer,
the music is just so happy.

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.380
Sade. I am never not listening to Sade.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.500
Roger Doyle and Caroline Polachek's cover

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.590
of "Spring is Coming With
a Strawberry in the Mouth"

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.150
I feel is very fitting.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.357
Oh, my nail tech just
gave me this right now

00:05:47.357 --> 00:05:50.955
during the shoot because I guess
my nails are falling apart.

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:52.500
So, I don't know what it is.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.556
I think it's supposed
to be this moisturizer,

00:05:54.556 --> 00:05:57.092
but she told me I just need to apply it

00:05:57.092 --> 00:06:00.150
every once in a while
because they're dying.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.352
And you work too much and then
people put acrylics on you

00:06:02.352 --> 00:06:04.545
or take 'em off or painting your nails

00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:05.520
and then take 'em off.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.930
And you're working with all
these different nail techs

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.070
and they all do something different.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.190
But Twi's the most consistent
one and she looks after me.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.023
That's my girl.

00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:13.590
Oh yeah, by the way, every 10 seconds,

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.780
if you feel like you're
going insane, you're not.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.780
There is a plane hovering going in circles

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.010
over and over and over again
and messing up the sound.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.757
Just because I know you
were at home thinking,

00:06:24.757 --> 00:06:27.420
"Ah man, why is the
sound going in and out?"

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.253
That's why.

00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:29.920
As soon as I get to London,
I sneeze all over the place.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.760
So, I have eye drops
that my mother gave me.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.660
Thank you, mom.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.860
I've been avoiding this for a while,

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.708
but I think it's just
because it's quite messy

00:06:36.708 --> 00:06:38.673
and I didn't really want to.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.160
Oh, I'm unrolling it.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.393
Dog business bags.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.220
I do have a dog.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.223
I got her when she was a puppy.

00:06:46.223 --> 00:06:49.020
She was the runt of her litter

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.858
and has kind of a funky
eye and was always sick.

00:06:51.858 --> 00:06:55.600
And she's my daughter
and we call her Twigs

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.130
'cause when she sleeps she
looks like a pile of twigs.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.750
It's a spider. Wait, hold on.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.240
Oh, he's jumping. It's not a spider.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.073
Wait.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.590
He's so cute.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.730
I used to do this on set.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.210
Because sometimes the
spiders get a little scared.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.790
So, sometimes if you configure
yourself in the right way,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.008
they'll start to make webs in your hand.

00:07:17.008 --> 00:07:18.450
Isn't that crazy?

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.520
Oh, he may have just
parachuted down though.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.354
That was Lucas.

00:07:21.354 --> 00:07:23.370
I went to a Charlie concert.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.070
She just had four sold out
nights, I think, in Barclays,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.260
which is insane in New York.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.480
So, I went and supported her. Love her.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.060
Oh, I've been using the
Dior lip glow butter

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.220
because it's hydrating and also just adds

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.150
a little bit of color.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.860
Sometimes I don't like too much.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.489
So, this has been my go-to lip treatment

00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:41.808
and I probably should be
using chapstick as well,

00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:43.560
but I don't have that in this bag.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.333
Pack of gum I haven't used yet.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.443
Theater tickets to "Warfare."

00:07:48.443 --> 00:07:50.310
Interesting war film.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.327
I'd never seen anything like it before.

00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:52.710
It all takes place in real time,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.080
which I thought was really smart.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.490
Flat key.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.710
I just remembered there's foxes

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.640
that keep lovemaking in my
backyard at this new flat.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.490
And it's a perfect flat besides that.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.847
And if you know, foxes when
they love each other very much,

00:08:09.847 --> 00:08:12.660
and a female fox and a
male fox get together,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.629
they scream at each
other really, really loud

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:16.650
at the worst hours of the night.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.240
There was a little bit
of like tack to that.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.670
And it was because I tried
to make fox repellent.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.350
When I went, I went "Shoo! Shoo."

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.240
'Cause that's what my
friends told me to do.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.521
And this guy took five steps closer,

00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:27.573
sat down and then started.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.260
I keep talking about... [giggles]

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.420
I keep talking about poop
in this video, but he just,

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.970
I just watched him on my yard.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.230
He didn't care.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.830
Oh, and then I have a proper
really well lived-in lip serum.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.600
This is, this is good stuff.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.800
All I have is a tampon.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.790
But how often do people
pull out the tampon and go?

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.495
It's quite obvious. This isn't even mine.

00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:50.613
Someone gave me this.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.590
I don't know where Lucas went.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.818
He's kind of a,

00:08:53.818 --> 00:08:55.260
he's a flaky guy.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.320
We try to catch each other
every time I'm in the city.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.490
And I didn't think I was
gonna see him this time,

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.170
but I guess he's been here the whole time.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.361
All right, well, that's
everything that was in my bag.

00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:05.040
That's all I have to share for you.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.360
It's pretty practical.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.800
Pretty much everything I need.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.450
Quite heavy, but I like it that way.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.470
Thank you so much for watching.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.700
I really, really appreciate it.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.200
Thank you, Vogue for having me.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.336
And I will see you guys around.

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:17.892
